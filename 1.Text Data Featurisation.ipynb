       "' HUNGARY HOPES DEVALUATION WILL END TRADE DEFICIT National Bank of Hungary first vice-president Janos Fekete said he hoped a planned eight pct devaluation of the forint will spur exports and redress last year\\'s severe trade deficit with the West. Fekete told Reuters in an interview Hungary must achieve at least equilibrium on its hard currency trade. \"It is useful to have a devaluation,\" he said. \"There is now a real push to our exports and a bit of a curb to our imports.\" The official news agency MTI said today Hungary would devalue by eight pct and it expected the new rates to be announced later today. Fekete said the rates would come into effect tomorrow. He said one reason for the devaluation was that Hungary had a higher rate of inflation over the past two years than its main partners (around eight pct in 1985 and between five and 5.5 pct in 1986). This was partly an after-effect of action Hungary took to prevent inflation from soaring during the oil price shocks of the 1970s, he added. Hungary devalued by a similar amount last September and by between three and four pct early last year. But the country\\'s hard currency trade balance nevertheless fell into a deficit of 539.4 mln dlrs from a surplus of 295.3 mln in 1986 and 1.2 billion in 1985. Fekete said Hungary was hoping for a hard currency trade surplus of between 200 and 300 mln dlrs this year, but that a more likely outcome would be closer to equilibrium on total hard currency trade of around 10 billion dlrs. One Western commercial attache here said: \"Devaluation of itself will not change anything. It will only be useful if they also make efforts to restructure industry and improve the quality of their export goods.\" Fekete said he hoped to raise credits on good terms this year to invest in restructuring industry. It would be his role to persuade international banks to cooperate in this process. He noted Hungary had been given an AA rating enabling it to raise money on the Japanese Samurai bond market. Hungary\\'s net hard currency debt soared to 7.79 billion dlrs last year from 5.01 billion in 1985, partly because of a current account deficit of 1.42 billion dlrs and partly because the fall in the dollar increased the dollar value of debt denominated in marks or yen. He said he feared net debt would also rise slightly this year, but he was in favour of borrowing for the purpose of modernisation. \"I am for credits to invest for that purpose,\" he said. \"I am against credits for consumption.\" He forecast gross domestic product growth of two pct this year, from one pct in 1986. Fekete said Hungary would continue to restructure its debt profile by prepaying high interest shorter and medium term loans with cheaper long term money for which it was looking more and more to the fixed interest rate bond market, where he considered rates to be low. Hard currency foreign exchange reserves would stay at around 3.5 billion dlrs, he said. On the budget deficit, which tripled to a provisional 47 billion forints last year after quadrupling in 1985, Fekete said the finance ministry was working out measures to reduce an approved target deficit for this year of 43.8 billion forints to between 30 and 35 billion forints.'"

       "'CANADA OIL EXPORTS RISE 20 PCT IN 1986 Canadian oil exports rose 20 pct in 1986 over the previous year to 33.96 mln cubic meters, while oil imports soared 25.2 pct to 20.58 mln cubic meters, Statistics Canada said. Production, meanwhile, was unchanged from the previous year at 91.09 mln cubic feet. Natural gas exports plunged 19.4 pct to 21.09 billion cubic meters, while Canadian sales slipped 4.1 pct to 48.09 billion cubic meters. The federal agency said that in December oil production fell 4.0 pct to 7.73 mln cubic meters, while exports rose 5.2 pct to 2.84 mln cubic meters and imports rose 12.3 pct to 2.1 mln cubic meters. Natural gas exports fell 16.3 pct in the month 2.51 billion cubic meters and Canadian sales eased 10.2 pct to 5.25 billion cubic meters. BP &lt;BP> DOES NOT PLAN TO HIKE STANDARD &lt;SRD> BID British Petroleum Co Plc does not intend to raise the price of its planned 70 dlr per share offer for the publicly held 45 pct of Standard Oil Co, BP Managing Director David Simon said. \"We don\\'t seen this as any progressive bidding game,\" he told reporters at a news conference. BP now owns 55 pct of Standard\\'s stock. Simon said BP had carefully considered the amount of its planned bid and he quoted an oil analyst, whom he would not identify, as saying BP\\'s careful evaluation means the company is not going to raise its offer. \"I think that (an increase) would be totally wrong. I think the price is very fair and it is much to early to speculate about ligigation,\" he said. \"Let\\'s wait and see how the offer runs.\" Another official declined to speculate under what circumstances BP might raise its bid. The BP official said the 70 dlrs a share offer is 7.2 times Standard\\'s 1986 cash flow and 56 pct above an independent evaluation of the company\\'s assets, including the value of its oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas reserves. He said the price Royal Dutch/Shell Group &lt;RD> &lt;SC> paid for publicly held Shell Oil Co shares in 1985 was 5.1 times cash flow. The BP official also said the 70 dlr bid is a 40 pct premium over Standard\\'s stock price over the past year. BP Group Treasurer Rodney Chase said more than half to as much as two-third\\'s of the 7.4 billion dlrs BP needs for its offer will come from existing sources. The rest will be financed by new debt. BP will draw in cash from its operating companies around the world and is also arranging a five billion dlr line of credit, he explained. The company\\'s debt to equity ratio will rise 11 or 12 percentage points from the current 33 pct if the offer is completed, Chase said. But the ratio will be back below 40 pct within 12 months, he added. Chase also said 50 to 60 pct of Standard Oil\\'s publicly held shares are held by financial institutions. Simon said Standard\\'s board was informed of the offer on March nine and has been considering it since that time. He said BP does not expect any regulatory problems that would delay completion of the acquisition. \"We have informed Washington of our intentions and we\\'ve already been an integral part of ownership of U.S. oil reserves,\" he pointed out. Simon said there is a good chance that current world oil prices of about 18 dlrs a barrel could be maintained, and that the more stable market is due mostly to changes in policy in Saudi Arabia and other OPEC members to control oil production. \"We think there are signals that current conditions are more favorable than they have been for sometime,\" Simon said. \"We have hopes for greater stability, but we do not see prices going much higher,\" he added. BP&lt;BP> OFFER RAISES EXPECTATIONS FOR OIL VALUES British Petroleum Plc\\'s plan to pay 7.4 billion dlrs for less than half of Standard Oil Co has signalled higher values in the U.S. oil patch, analysts said. \"I think that BP\\'s bid is a very strong affirmation and clear signal that they have confidence in the U.S., and they think the barrel of oil in the ground is going to go higher,\" said Sanford Margoshes of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. BP earlier today said its U.S. unit planned to tender at 70 dlrs per share for the 45 pct of Standard it does not already own. \"It\\'s a 7.4 billion dlr price that (shows) OPEC has won the war and oil prices are not going to crack,\" said Prescott, Ball and Turben analyst Bruce Lazier. \"Behind that is a huge implication for the rest of the energy issues out there in the stock market, particularly those that are acquisition targets,\" Lazier said. One of those mentioned by Lazier was USX Corp, an energy-steel concern which had been courted by investor Carl Icahn and drew the attention of Australian Robert Holmes a Court last year. Rumors continue to swirl around its stock. Margoshes said he does not foresee major U.S. oil firms falling into takeover situations for several years, with the exception of possibly Amerada Hess Corp &lt;AHC>. He said most of the majors found partners in the last round of matchmaking which ended two years ago, and others restructured to the point that they have become unattractive. U.S. oil stocks rallied in response to the offer. Exxon Corp &lt;XON> rose 1-1/8 to 88-1/2. Chevron Corp &lt;CHV> jumped 1-1/8 to 58-7/8, and Texaco &lt;TX> climbed 1/4 to 37-3/4. Unocal Corp &lt;UCL> rose 1-3/4, while Occidental Petroleum Corp &lt;OXY> climbed 1-1/8 to 34-3/4. Amoco Corp &lt;AN> rose 1-3/8 to 83-3/4. Standard Oil\\'s stock was up 6-1/4 in heavy trading to 71-1/8. Earlier in the session it had been at a high of 72-1/4. Wall Street has speculated British Petroleum may boost its offer by several dlrs per share, but the company maintained it would not raise the 70 dlr bid. British Petroleum stock rose 2-1/4 to 59-5/8. Analysts said the fact British Petroleum made such a bid in the first place indicates that the British oil giant has changed its outlook for the oil industry. Analysts said last year British Petroleum held one of the more bearish positions on oil prices. \"They said the real price of oil would stay at 15 dlrs (a barrel) for several years, and I think they beat a hasty retreat from that point of view,\" Margoshes said. \"They are more appropriately today looking more optimistically. I believe they are looking at 18 dlrs (long-term)...also in their heart of hearts they believe that will be exceeded,\" Margoshes said. The U.S. benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate was trading today around 18.60 dlrs per barrel. Analysts said British Petroleum might have been able to buy up the rest of Standard Oil for about 50 dlrs per share when oil prices were falling last year. They said Standard Oil\\'s brightest asset is its slightly more than 50 pct ownership of the Alaskan Prudhoe Bay oil field. Analysts also said the company has other interests in the Alaskan North Slope. Analysts said the Standard investment is extremely attractive to BP because the U.S. is the largest oil market and has hard-to-replace reserves. \"I think it just fits in with their long-range plans to increase their position in the U.S. market,\" Dean Witter analyst Eugene Nowak said. Analysts said it also raises BP\\'s visibility ahead of the British government\\'s announced disposal of 31.7 pct of BP stock. The U.K. government said it would dispose of the holding sometime in the year beginning April one. After acquiring all of Standard, most of BP\\'s reserves would be in the U.S., but only about six pct of its stock is held in the U.S. \"The only way they can sell all that stock is to move it into the United States. No other market can handle all that stock,\" said L.F. rothschild analyst Rosario Ilacqua. In 1986, Standard Oil had net losses of 345 mln dlrs on revenues of 10.02 billion dlrs, compared to a profit the year earlier of 308 mln dlrs on revenues of 13.82 billion dlrs. USX &lt;X> SAYS TALKS ENDED WITH BRITISH PETROLEUM USX Corp chairman David Roderick said the company had ended talks with British Petroleum Co Plc &lt;BP> about the possible sale of some energy assets and said USX has no immediate restructuring plans for its oil businesses. \"We have terminated our discussions,\" Roderick told Reuters after a speech to the Petroleum Equipment Suppliers Association here. He said USX was not conducting talks with any other possible buyer of its energy assets. Earlier today, BP said it planned to offer 70 dlrs per share for the Standard Oil Co\\'s &lt;SRD> publicly held stock. USX said in December the company had held formal discussions with BP about the potential sale of some of its overseas oil assets and USX had received expressions of interest from a half dozen other oil companies. Roderick, in response to a question, said USX had no immediate plans to restructure its Marathon Oil Co, or Texas Oil and Gas Corp. He said USX also did not plan to sell any of its 49 pct interest in the giant Yates Field in west Texas. \"We want to maintain our production in the Yates Field during these difficult times,\" Roderick added. In response to a question, Roderick also said he did not know whether Australian investor Robert Holmes a Court was accumulating USX stock. In recent days, traders have suggested Holmes a Court was buying additional shares. Roderick said Carl Ichan, who terminated an eight billion dlr hostile takeover plan for USX in January, continued to hold a sizable interest in the company. \"Mr. Ichan still apparently has 11.4 pct. He hasn\\'t bought any more stock or sold any,\" Roderick said. \"He\\'s a very satisfied shareholder right now. I talk with him monthly.\" In his speech, Roderick predicted the fall in the value of the dollar would set the stage for the U.S. to solve its trade deficit problem which totaled 170 billion dlrs in 1986. \"I expect by the early 1990s the U.S. will be running a net trade surplus,\" Roderick said. \"I think the worst is over and we can look forward to stability and upward movement ahead.\" However, the USX chairman warned that European trading partners may resist the turn in the U.S. trade deficit. \"Some economic discomfort must be transferred from the United States to our friends, trading partners and allies.\" BP &lt;BP> MAY HAVE TO RAISE BID -  ANALYSTS British Petroleum Co PLC may have to raise its planned 70 dlrs a share tender offer for the publicly traded shares of Standard Oil Co &lt;SRD>, analysts said. \"There\\'s a lot of speculation here that someway or other they would be forced to come up with another bid,\" said Rosario Ilaqua of L.F. Rothschild. And despite BP managing director David Simon\\'s denial today that BP would raise the offer, the analysts said that remained a distinct possibility. Analysts said they base their thinking on Royal Dutch/Shell Group\\'s &lt;RD> &lt;SC> bid to buy the outstanding stake of Shell Oil Co in 1984 and 1985. Royal Dutch/Shell eventually raised its initial 55 dlrs a share offer to 60 dlrs a share, after lawsuits by minority shareholders. \"I think they\\'re going to have to go a little higher eventually, just as Royal Dutch/Shell had to go a little higher for the Shell Oil minority shares,\" Bruce Lazier of Prescott Ball and Turben said. He estimated a price of 75 dlrs a share. Royal Dutch/Shell offered 55 dlrs a share for the 30.5 pct of Shell Oil it did not already own in January of 1984. After objections from minority shareholders about the price, Royal Dutch/Shell raised its bid and began a 58 dlrs a share tender offer in April 1984. But shareholders sued and a court blocked completion of the offer. After months of wrangling over the worth of Shell Oil, Royal Dutch/Shell agreed to another two dlrs increase. It ended up paying 5.67 billion dlrs for the outstanding Shell Oil stake, a significant premium to its original bid of about 5.2 billion dlrs. The analysts made their comments before Simon\\'s remarks at a BP press conference in New York this afternoon. Sanford Margoshes of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc told clients this morning that a sweetened offer was possible. The analyst said the bid could be raised by two dlrs a share. Analysts do not expect regulatory hurdles because of the Royal Dutch/Shell group precedent. But there may be shareholder lawsuits for the same reason, they said. Goldman Sachs and Co, BP\\'s investment advisor, advised the Shell Oil board in 1984 and 1985. STANDARD OIL &lt;SRD> SEES BOOST IN 1987 CASH FLOW Standard Oil Co expects the sale of assets and federal tax refunds resulting from last year\\'s loss to add about one billion dlrs to its normal cash flows from operations in 1987, its annual report said. Last year, the report noted, the cash flow from operations dropped to 1.8 billion dlrs from 3.5 billion dlrs in 1985 and 3.2 billion dlrs in 1984 due principally to lower oil prices. The report, prepared before British Petroleum Co Plc &lt;BP> disclosed plans to seek the rest of Standard\\'s stock, put 1987 capital spending at 1.6 billion dlrs, down from the 1.7 billion dlrs projected in January. Standard\\'s capital spending totaled 1.77 billion dlrs in 1986. The report showed a decline in proven oil reserves to 2.41 billion barrels at the end of 1986 from 2.65 billion barrels a year earlier as discoveries and other additions dropped to 11.4 mln barrels last year from 23.2 mln in 1985. But it said gas reeserves rose to 7.31 trillion cubic feet from 7.22 trillion at the end of 1985 despite a 30.9 mln cubic feet downward revision in previous reserve estimates during 1986. Discoveries and other additions totaled 200.5 billion cubic feet last year, up from 175.9 billion in 1985, it added. Standard said both oil and gas production increased last year -- to 726,600 barrels per day from 719,700 barrels the previous day and to 154.4 mln cubic feet daily from 10.1 mln in 1985. But the average sales price of both dropped -- to 13.83 dlrs per barrel from 26.43 dlrs for oil in 1985 and to 1.49 dlrs per thousand cubic feet from 2.18 dlrs a year earlier. Standard said its refined product sales also rose last year, to 644,500 barrels per day from 604,200 barrels daily in 1985. NEXT FEW MONTHS CRUCIAL FOR OIL - HERNANDEZ Energy and Mines Minister Arturo Hernandez Grisanti today told a meeting of regional oil exporters the next few months will be critical to efforts to achieve price recovery and stabilize the market. Hernandez said while OPEC and non-OPEC nations have already made some strides in their efforts to strengthen the market, the danger of a reversal is always present. \"March and the next two or three months will be a really critical period,\" Hernandez said. He said, \"We will be able to define a movement, either towards market stability and price recovery or, depending on the market, a reversal.\" Earlier this week, Hernandez said Venezuela\\'s oil price has averaged just above 16 dlrs a barrel for the year to date. If OPEC achieves its stated goal of an 18 dlrs a barrel average price, he said, Venezuela\\'s should move up to 16.50 dlrs. Hernandez spoke today at the opening of the fifth ministerial meeting of the informal group of Latin American and Caribbean oil exporters, formed in 1983. Ministers from member states Ecuador, Mexico, Trinidad-Tobago and Venezuela are attending the two day conference, while Colombia is present for the first time as an observer. Hernandez defined the meeting as an informal exchange of ideas about the oil market. However, the members will also discuss ways to combat proposals for a tax on imported oil currently before the U.S. Congress. Following the opening session, the group of ministers met with President Jaime Lusinchi at Miraflores, the presidential palace. The delegations to the conference are headed by Hernandez of Venezuela, Energy Minister Javier Espinosa of Ecuador, Energy Minister Kelvin Ramnath of Trinidad-Tobago, Jose Luis Alcudiai, assistant energy secretary of Mexico and Energy Minister Guilermno Perry Rubio of Colombia. BRAZIL OIL OUTPUT FELL IN FEBRUARY, USAGE UP Brazilian crude oil and liquefied natural gas production fell to an average 583,747 barrels per day in February from 596,740 in the same 1986 month, the state oil company Petrobras said. The drop was due to operating problems in the Campos Basin, the country\\'s main producing area, where output was down to 346,011 bpd from 357,420, a Petrobras statement said. Consumption of oil derivatives totalled 1.14 mln bpd in February, 16.7 pct up on February last year but down from the record 1.22 mln bpd used in October last year. Use of alcohol fuel in February was 208,600 bpd, 42 pct above February, 1986. OIL EXECUTIVES SEE GRADUAL RISE IN PRICES Top executives with Tenneco Corp &lt;TGT> and Sabine Corp &lt;SAB> said they expected world oil prices to gradually increase over the next two years as U.S. reliance on imports of oil from the Middle East grows. \"I believe we have bottomed out and can look forward to a trend of gradually increasing prices,\" C.W. Nance, president of Tenneco Oil Exploration and Production, told a meeting of the Petroleum Equipment Suppliers Association. Nance predicted that by 1990, the Organization of Producing and Exporting Countries would be producing at the rate of 80 pct of capacity. The gain will come largely through increased imports to the United States, he said. \"They will be able to raise the price again but I do not think they will raise it as much as they did in 1979,\" Nance said. He did not say how much of a price hike he expected. Andrew Shoup, chairman of Dallas-based Sabine, predicted that world oil prices would increase from a range of 15 to 20 dlrs a barrel in 1987 to a range of 17 to 22 dlrs a barrel in 1988. Natural gas prices, Shoup said, should similarly climb from a range of 1.30 to 1.70 dlrs per mcf this year to between 1.50 and 1.90 dlrs per mcf in 1988. \"Fuel switching could help us as much as five pct in increased demand,\" Shoup said, referring to the gas industry\\'s outlook for 1987. Repeal of the Fuel Use Act, a federal law prohibiting the use of natural gas in new manufacturing plants and utilities, could increase demand for gas by as much as 15 pct, he said. Tenneco\\'s Nance also said that some U.S. cities may experience peak day shortages in natural gas supplies next winter because of the industry\\'s reduced deliverability. Tenneco\\'s gas deliverability, for example, dropped by 20 pct during 1986, he said. \"This does not mean the gas bubble is gone,\" Nance said. \"We believe gas prices have bottomed out. The real question is how broad the valley is -- is it one year, two years or three years before we start to climb out?\" J.C. Walter of &lt;Walter Oil and Gas Corp>, said the recent improvement in oil prices was not enough for independent producers to begin new onshore drilling projects. \"If crude oil stays below 20 dlrs a barrel and 1.50 dlr per mcf for natural gas prevails, the prospects for onshore exploration at deeper depths in the Texas Gulf Coast by independents in the 1990s are pretty dismal,\" Walter said. He suggested that some independents may instead turn to exploration in shallow federal offshore leases. Farm-out agreements, cheap rig rates and less competition have held finding costs in those areas to five or six dlrs a barrel, Walter said. KENYAN ECONOMY FACES PROBLEMS, PRESIDENT SAYS The Kenyan economy is heading for difficult times after a boom last year, and the country must tighten its belt to prevent the balance of payments swinging too far into deficit, President Daniel Arap Moi said. In a speech at the state opening of parliament, Moi said high coffee prices and cheap oil in 1986 led to economic growth of five pct, compared with 4.1 pct in 1985. The same factors produced a two billion shilling balance of payments surplus and inflation fell to 5.6 pct from 10.7 pct in 1985, he added. \"But both these factors are no longer in our favour ... As a result, we cannot expect an increase in foreign exchange reserves during the year,\" he said. The price of coffee, Kenya\\'s main source of foreign exchange, fell in London today to about 94 cents a pound from a peak of 2.14 dlrs in January 1986. Crude oil, which early last year slipped below 10 dlrs a barrel, has since crept back to over 18 dlrs. Moi said the price changes, coupled with a general decline in the flow of capital from the rest of the world, made it more difficult to finance the government\\'s budget deficit. Kenya was already spending over 27 pct of its budget on servicing its debts and last year it was a net exporter of capital for the first time in its history, he added. \"This is a clear indication that we are entering a difficult phase as regards our external debts, and it is imperative that we raise the rate of domestic savings and rely less on foreign sources to finance our development,\" he said. \"It will be necessary to maintain strict discipline on expenditure ... And members of this house will have to take the lead in encouraging wananchi (ordinary people) to be more frugal in satisfying immediate needs,\" the president added. INDIA STEPS UP COUNTERTRADE DEALS TO CUT TRADE GAP India is searching for non-communist countertrade partners to help it cut its trade deficit and conserve foreign exchange. Wheat, tobacco, tea, coffee, jute, engineering and electronic goods, as well as minerals including iron ore, are all on offer in return for crude oil, petroleum products, chemicals, steel and machinery, trade sources told Reuters. Most of the impetus behind countertrade, which began in 1984, comes from two state trading firms -- the State Trading Corp (STC) and the Minerals and Metals Trading Corp (MMTC). \"The two state trading corporations are free to use their buying power in respect to bulk commodities to promote Indian exports,\" a commerce ministry spokeswoman said, adding that private firms are excluded from countertrading. One trade source said India has targetted countries that depend on an Indian domestic market recently opened to foreign imports. However, countertrade deals still make up only a small part of India\\'s total trading and are likely to account for less than eight pct of the estimated 18.53 billion dlrs in trade during the nine months ended December, the sources said. Countertrade accounted for just five pct of India\\'s 25.65 billion dlrs in trade during fiscal 1985/86 ended March, against almost nothing in 1984/85, official figures show. However, the figures exclude exchanges with the Eastern Bloc paid in non-convertible Indian rupees, the sources said. Total trade with the Soviet Union, involving swaps of agricultural produce and textiles for Soviet arms and crude oil, is estimated at 3.04 billion dlrs in fiscal 1986/87, against three billion in 1985/86. Indian countertrade, which is being promoted mainly to help narrow the country\\'s large trade deficit, is still insignificant compared with agreements reached by Indonesia, Venezuela and Brazil, the trade sources said. The trade deficit, which hit an estimated record 6.96 billion dlrs in 1985/86, is expected to decline to 5.6 billion in the current fiscal year. But the push to include non-communist countries in countertrade is also due to other factors, including the slow growth of foreign reserves, a tight debt repayment schedule, shrinking aid and trade protectionism, businessmen said. One source said India is showing more dynamism in promoting countertrade deals than in the past, when the deals were made discreetly because they break GATT rules. As a member of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), India cannot officially support bartering. The MMTC\\'s recent countertrade deals include iron ore exports to Yugoslavia for steel structures and rails. \"MMTC\\'s recent global tenders now include a clause that preference will be given to parties who accept payment in kind for goods and services sold to India,\" a trade official said, adding that the policy remains flexible. \"We also take into account other factors such as prices at which the goods and services are offered to India,\" the trade official said. Early this year the commerce ministry quietly told foreign companies interested in selling aircraft, ships, drilling rigs and railway equipment to India that they stood a better chance if they bought Indian goods or services in return, the trade sources said. Illustrating the point, the official said a South Korean firm recently agreed to sell a drilling platform worth 40 mln dlrs to the state-run Oil and Natural Gas Commission. In return, the South Koreans gave a verbal assurance to buy Indian goods worth 10 pct of the contract, against the 25 pct sought by New Delhi, the trade official said. \"We selected the Korean firm because its bid was the lowest,\" he added. Countertrade is helping African countries short of foreign currency to import goods. India has signed a trade protocol to buy up to 15,000 tonnes of asbestos fibre from Zimbabwe in exchange for Indian goods, including jute bags and cars. But despite India\\'s new drive, countertrade has some inherent problems, they added. \"It is not always easy to meet the basic requirement that the trade should always be balanced,\" one trade source said. \"The other problem is it is often difficult to supply or buy commodities which the other party wants.\" Another added, \"Barter is also restrictive. We look upon it as a temporary measure to get over the current balance of payments difficulty. \"This is why countertrade has not been made a law in India. It does not even figure in the country\\'s foreign trade policy.\" PAPANDREOU SAYS GREEKS READY FOR AGGRESSORS Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou said today that the Greek armed froces were ready to tackle any aggressors following the sailing of a Turkish research vessel and warships towards disputed waters in the Aegean Sea. Papandreou told an emergency cabinet meeting in Athens \"the military readiness of our country is able now to give a very hard lesson if our neighbours (Turkey) were to carry out military actions.\" He said the activities of the research vessel could be aimed at partitioning the Aegean. \"The air force, navy and army are in a state of alert,\" General Guven Ergenc, Secretary General of the Turkish General Staff, told a news conference. He said the Turkish research ship Sismik 1, escorted by an unspecified number of warships, would sail into disputed waters in the Aegean Sea tomorrow morning. Ergenc told Reuters later that all leave had been cancelled for members of the armed forces in the Aegean coast area. The Turkish government said yesterday it had licensed the state-owned Turkish Petroleum Corp to explore for oil in international waters around three Greek islands off Turkey. Greece and Turkey have long-standing disputes over areas of the Aegean and the presence of Turkish troops in Cyprus. The latest row erupted when the Greek government said last month that it was taking control of a Canadian-led consortium which was already producing oil off the Greek island of Thassos and would drill in the same area after the takeover. Ergenc told the news conference the alert followed a government decision that Turkey should protect its interests \"because of measures Greece has been taking in the Aegean in violation of international agreements.\" Asked how Turkey would react if Greece attacked any of the vessels, he said \"If there is an attack, it is clear what has to be done. An attack on a warship is a cause for war.\" But he added \"We are not in a state of war. The measures taken by the military are directed towards protecting our rights.\" Greece said yesterday it would defend its national rights in the Aegean and urged Turkey to accept reference of the dispute to the International Court of Justice in The Hague. Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman Yalim Eralp told reporters today this was unacceptable because of preconditions Athens had attached. In Athens, Greek Prime Minister Papandreou said that if the Turkish vessel Sismik 1 began research operations \"we will hinder it, of course not with words, as it cannot be stopped with words.\" Greek newspapers said the armed forces were on alert and navy ships had gone to the Aegean. But government spokesman Yannis Roubatis did not confirm the move, saying only \"The Greek fleet is not at its naval base.\" Papandreou said that a map issued in Turkey showed 95 pct of the areas proposed for research were on the Greek continental shelf. Papandreou told the U.S. And NATO that if they had a part in orchestrating the present crisis in order to force Greece to negotiate with Turkey, the Greek government would not accept it. Papandreou has maintained in the past that he will not negotiate with Ankara until Turkey recognises Greek rights in the Aegean and withdraws its troops from Cyprus. He said that in the case of war with Turkey it would not be possible for Greece to discuss the future of American military bases here. Asked by reporters if he would close the U.S. Bases in Greece in the event of war, Papandreou replied \"Obviously, and perhaps even before the war.\" INDIA STEPS UP COUNTERTRADE DEALS India is searching for non-communist countertrade partners to help it cut its trade deficit and conserve foreign exchange. Wheat, tobacco, tea, coffee, jute, engineering and electronic goods, as well as minerals including iron ore, are all on offer in return for crude oil, petroleum products, chemicals, steel and machinery, trade sources told Reuters.

Total trade with the Soviet Union, involving swaps of agricultural produce and textiles for Soviet arms and crude oil, is estimated at 3.04 billion dlrs in fiscal 1986/87. NATO HOLDS EMERGENCY MEETING ON AEGEAN CRISIS NATO ambassadors met in emergency session today to discuss tension between members Greece and Turkey over a disputed area of the Aegean Sea on the Western Alliance\\'s southern flank, Greek diplomatic sources said. They said no information had yet emerged from the meeting, called after statements from both countries that they were prepared to back rival oil exploration teams with warships. General Guven Ergenc, Secretary General of the Turkish General Staff, said today the Turkish research ship Sismik 1, escorted by an unspecified number of warships, would sail into disputed waters in the Aegean Sea tomorrow morning. Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou said \"The military readiness of our country is able now to give a very hard lesson if our neighbours (Turkey) were to carry out military actions.\" The row erupted when the Greek government said last month that it was taking control of a Canadian-led consortium which was already producing oil off the Greek island of Thassos and would drill in the same area after the takeover. NATO CALLS ON GREECE AND TURKEY TO AVOID FORCE Greece and Turkey\\'s NATO allies today called on both countries to avoid any action that could aggravate an explosive situation in the Aegean and \"avoid recourse to force at all costs.\" After an emergency meeting of NATO ambassadors, a statement was issued saying \"the present situation damages the interests of Greece and Turkey, and of the Alliance as a whole.\" Secretary-General Lord Carrington also offered himself as a mediator in the dispute on the Western Alliance\\'s southern flank. The meeting was called after reports that warships of both countries were sailing towards a disputed oil exploration zone of the Aegean. The statement said the tensions in the area had reached a serious level and called on both countries to begin immediate discussions. \"Any intensification would make things worse,\" it added. No attempt was made at the meeting to resolve the complex dispute which was aimed at damage-limitation. Carrington said, \"I am of course anxious to help in any way I can, provided that both Greece and Turkey, and the other allies, wish me to do so.\" U.S. ENERGY COSTS ROSE IN FEBRUARY BY 1.9 PCT Consumer energy costs rose 1.9 pct in February following a sharp rise last month, the Labor Department said. The February increase in the overall energy costs, including petroleum, coal and natural gas, followed a 0.2 pct drop in December and a 3.0 pct rise in January, it said. Energy prices were 12.2 pct below year-ago levels. The department\\'s Consumer Price Index showed that the cost of gasoline rose in February by 4.2 pct, after a 6.6 pct rise in January. Gasoline prices were nonetheless 18.0 pct below their levels as of February 1986. Also, the category including fuel oil, coal and bottled gas rose in February by 3.8 pct, putting it 14.9 pct under the year-ago figure. The index also showed that natural gas and electricity were unchanged last month, but down 3.5 pct from the February 1986 figure, the department said. The index has been updated  o reflect 1982-84 consumption patterns; previously, the index was based on 1972-73 patterns. U.S. URGES RESTRAINT IN AEGEAN The United States said it was doing what it could to ease tension in the Aegean as Greek and Turkish warships headed for a possible clash over oil drilling rights on the sea\\'s continental shelf. State Department spokesman Charles Redman told reporters, \"We have urged both sides to exercise restraint and avoid any actions which might exacerbate the situation.\" \"In the light of the most recent developments, we are consulting with the parties and with other interested allies on means to reduce tensions,\" he added. Redman declined to elaborate on what Washington was doing, but he said an emergency meeting of NATO ambassadors in Brussels on the subject was only one path it was pursuing. He also refused to say which side was to blame for the renewed confrontation, saying Washington was still trying to ascertain all the facts, as Prime minister Andreas Papanderou said Greece was prepared to tackle any aggressor. \"The crucial point here is that these are two friends and allies. We don\\'t want to see tension rise and we are doing what we can to see if we can help here,\" Redman said. TURKISH SHIP IN OIL ROW HEADS FOR AEGEAN A Turkish research ship, escorted by warships and air force planes, left for the Aegean to press Ankara\\'s case in an escalating row with Greece over oil rights, the semi-official Anatolian News Agency said. The ship set off this morning from the Dardanelles port of Canakkale with flags flying and watched by sightseers, the agency said. Prime Minister Turgut Ozal said last night the ship would not go into international waters unless Greece did the same. \"We are waiting for the first move from them,\" he told Turkish Radio in London. PAPANDREOU SHOWS \"RESTRICTED OPTIMISM\" OVER CRISIS Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou expressed \"restricted optimism\" about a crisis with Turkey over disputed oil rights in the Aegean Sea. Papandreou was speaking to reporters after briefing opposition political leaders on the latest developments in the row as a Turkish research ship escorted by warships and combat aircraft headed for the Aegean. He and other political leaders spoke of qualified optimism following a statement by Turkish Premier Turgut Ozal last night that the research vessel would not enter disputed waters as previously annnounced unless Greek vessels did so. The Prime Minister declined to answer reporters\\' questions about an announcement last night that Greece had asked the United States to suspend operations at one of the American military bases here due to the crisis. But Opposition leader Constantine Mitsotakis told reporters he thought the suspension would be temporary until the crisis is resolved. A U.S. Defence Department official in Washington said the station was still functioning. Communist Party leader Harilaos Florakis said here \"the climate is calmer today.\" Greek newspapers reported that the Greek army, navy and air force had been moved to strategic Greek islands in the Aegean and to the land border with Turkey at the Evros River. But there was no official word on military movements apart from a comment by the government spokesman that the Greek navy was no longer in port. The United States, NATO and the United Nations all called on Greece and Turkey to exercise restraint. Greek U.N. Representative Mihalis Dounas said in a letter to the secretary-general that the dispute was of a legal nature and could be settled in the International Court in the Hague. TURKISH-GREEK AEGEAN TENSION ABATES Turkey\"s standoff with Greece over Aegean oil rights appeared at an end after the government said it had been assured Athens would not start prospecting in disputed waters. A Foreign Ministry statement last night hinted Turkey was claiming victory. A Greek-based international consortium, North Aegean Petroleum Co., Had given up plans to start searching for oil in international waters east of Thasos island, it said. \"In the same way it has been understood that Greece will also not undertake oil activities outside its territorial waters,\" the statement added. An Ankara Radio report monitored in London said Foreign Minister Vahit Halefolu had called on Greece to engage in dialogue over the dispute. It was impossible to resolve the dispute by crises, he was quoted as saying. \"We call on Greece to come and engage in a dialogue with us - let us find a solution as two neighbours and allies should,\" he said. The radio said Halefoglu had briefed the leaders of a number of the country\"s political parties on the latest developments. Turkey sent the survey ship Sismik 1 into the Aegean yesterday, flanked by warships, to press its case but having earlier said it would go into disputed waters, declared the vessel would stay in Turkish areas. Prime Minister Turgut Ozal, in London on his way home after heart surgery in the United States, is expected to receive an ecstatic welcome from thousands of Turks when he returns today. He was in defiant mood last night, telling Turkish radio: \"We can never accept that Greece should confine us to the Anatolian continent. If there are riches under the sea, they are for mankind.\" Despite the end of the crisis, Turkish officials acknowledged that the underlying dispute over delimiting the continental shelf in the Aegean remained unsolved. Turkey alleged that the consortium\"s plans would have infringed the 1976 Berne agreement between the two countries, which called for a moratorium on any activities until the delimitation was agreed. Greece earlier this month declared it considers the accord inoperative. BANK SEES MODEST RECOVERY IN GULF ARAB ECONOMIES The Emirates Industrial Bank has predicted a modest economic recovery in the Gulf Arab states following higher oil revenues. A bank study, carried by the Emirates news agency WAM, said total oil revenues of the six Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries were likely to reach 39 billion dlrs this year from 33.5 billion in 1986. The GCC groups Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The bank said the improvement would result from higher oil prices made possible by last December\\'s OPEC accord to restrain overall group production. These curbs have pushed up oil prices from around eight dollars a barrel in mid-1986 to around 18 dlrs. \"All signs point to the possibility of a modest recovery in the economies of these (GCC) countries, although this expected growth will not be similar to that of the (1970s) boom years,\" the study said. It added, however, that GCC states would experience higher budget deficits this year because of needs arising from past recession and the difficulty of making fresh spending cuts. The study said the combined GCC bugdet deficits would rise to 23.2 billion dlrs from 17.9 billion last year. It said lower oil exports cut the GCC states\\' combined trade surplus to 18 billion dlrs in 1986 from 21.5 billion in 1985. The UAE suffered a 19.5 pct drop in gross domestic product to 77.6 billion dirhams last year from 96.4 billion in 1985, it added. TURKEY LIFTS SURVEY SHIP ESCORT AS TENSION ABATES Turkey pulled warships back from close escort of its Sismik 1 survey ship as the threat of conflict with Greece over oil rights in the Aegean Sea abated. The semi-official Anatolian Agency said naval vessels ended their close protection of the ship as it continued work in Turkish waters but were following it at a distance. Popular newspapers headlined what they saw as Turkish resolve and international pressure forcing Greece to pull back from planned exploration in disputed international waters. \"Intense United States and NATO efforts bore fruit: Greece will stay in its national waters,\" said the daily Gunes. The top-selling Hurriyet topped its front page with: \"Our resolute stand made Greece see reason.\" But two newspapers, Cumhuriyet and Milliyet, noted in identical headlines -- \"Crisis Frozen\" -- that the basic disagreement over exploration rights remained unsolved. The confrontation eased after the Turkish government said it had been assured Athens would not begin prospecting in disputed waters. 29-MAR-1987 29-MAR-1987 INDONESIA LIMITS OIL PRICE IMPACT-FINANCE MINISTER Indonesia has minimised the economic impact of falling oil prices, kept inflation within limits and boosted exports, Finance Minister Radius Prawiro said. Indonesia was badly hit by last year\\'s steep plunge in crude prices, which cut revenue from oil exports by half. But Prawiro was quoted by Indonesian newspapers as telling President Suharto that inflation was kept to around nine pct in the financial year ending tomorrow, against around 4.3 pct the previous year. Exports were estimated to have risen by seven pct, he said, although he did not give complete figures. The depressed economy forms the main backdrop to general elections next month in Indonesia, a major producer of rubber, palm oil, tin, timber and coffee. Prawiro said 1986/87 had also been difficult because of the appreciation of currencies like the yen and the mark against the dollar, which increased Indonesia\\'s debt repayments. He said the economy would have suffered more from the world economic recession if the government had not devalued the rupiah by 31 pct last September. In an editorial on the economic outlook, the Jakarta Post said the government must press ahead with measures to deregulate the economy to help boost non-oil exports. The English-language daily said bigger export earnings were needed to finance not only imports but also the country\\'s growing foreign debt, estimated at around 37 billion dlrs. \"About 50 pct of our foreign debt obligations fall due within the next three to five years and will steadily increase the debt servicing burden,\" the paper said. However, end-investors were seen bargain hunting in expectation of a further yen interest rate decline, dealers said. Most dealers were cautious in the face of the dollar\\'s nosedive today and the possibility of a U.S. Interest rate rebound to halt further dollar depreciation. A 4.7 pct coupon and volume of 1,400 billion yen for the April 10-year bond proposed by the Finance Ministry this afternoon were taken favourably by the market. BP U.K. REFINERY DUE TO PARTLY RE-OPEN NEXT WEEK The British Petroleum Co PLC (BP.L) oil refinery at Grangemouth, closed after an explosion and fire eight days ago, is expected to partially reopen next week, a refinery spokesman said. He said the entire 178,500 bpd refinery has been shut since the accident which killed one person and damaged the site\\'s hydrocracker. The main units will resume operation next week but the hydrocracker will be closed for an unspecified period. The spokesman said the refinery had been operating at about half its capacity since end-January due to overhaul work on part of the complex. The overhaul is expected to end by late April. GREECE SCRAPS U.S. BASE CLOSURE REQUEST Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou has withdrawn a request to Washington to suspend operations at an American army base near Athens as a Greek-Turkish row over oil rights in the Aegean eased. A Turkish research ship which Greece had threatened to tackle if it sailed into disputed waters in the Aegean Sea kept to Turkish territorial waters yesterday, avoiding a potential clash. Papandreou expressed qualified optimism after briefing opposition leaders on Aegean developments early yesterday. The Greek government later withdrew Friday\\'s request to Washington to close down its telecommunications base at Nea Makri, north of Athens, saying that the reasons which had prompted it to make the request were no longer valid. Under the terms of the U.S.-Greek bases accord, Greece has the right to ask for suspension of operations at times when its national interests are threatened. The row in the Aegean erupted after Turkey said it would search for oil round three Greek islands off its coast following an announcement from Greece that it planned to drill east of Thassos island after taking control of a Canadian-led oil consortium operating in the northern Aegean. Turkey accused Greece of breaching the 1976 Berne Agreement under which both sides agreed to preserve the status quo in the Aegean until their continental shelf dispute was settled. Athens says it considers the accord inactive. The Turkish Foreign Ministry said in a statement it had received an assurance from Greece that it would not carry out oil activities outside its territorial waters. Greece declined comment on the statement. Papandreou repeated an invitation to Turkey to take the long-standing continental shelf dispute to the International Court of Justice at The Hague. Conservative opposition leader Constantine Mitsotakis said he had urged Papandreou to accept an offer from NATO General Secretary Lord Carrington to help resolve the row. MEXICAN FIRST QTR CRUDE EXPORTS SEEN AT 15.25 DLRS The average price of mexico\\'s crude oil exports in first quarter 1987 will be 15.25 dlrs per barrel, according to preliminary figures issued in a press release by the state oil company Petroleos Mexicanos (PEMEX). It gave no direct comparison with the year-ago figure but said crude and products sales were expected to rise to 1.99 billion dlrs this quarter, 420 mln dlrs higher than expected and 22 pct better than the year-ago quarter. Prospects for the second quarter were relatively favourable with crude exports seen at 1.320 mln bpd after an expected 1.324 mln this month, 1.323 in February and 1.395 mln in January.

CRUDE OIL NETBACKS UP IN U.S., MEDITERRANEAN Crude oil netback values in complex refineries rose slightly in the U.S. and the Mediterranean last Friday from the previous week but were lower elsewhere, according to calculations by Reuters Pipeline. The soft tone to refining margins reflects large worldwide stocks of petroleum products and thin trading activity, traders said. In the U.S. Gulf, sweet crudes rose in value by as much as 26 cts a barrel for West Texas Intermediate, an increase of 1.4 pct from the previous Friday, while sour crudes, such as Alaska North Slope, were up one pct. In the Mediterranean, netback values were up 17 cts to 22 cts a barrel, with Arab Light up 17 cts a barrel to 18.62 dlrs, a 0.9 pct increase from the previous Friday and Urals were up 22 cts a barrel to 19.16 dlrs, a 1.2 pct increase. But netbacks for crude oil refined in Northern Europe was generally lower with Brent valued at 18.89 dlrs, off 30 cts from the previous friday, and Bonny Light was off 17 cts to 19.58 dlrs a barrel. Refinery netbacks in Singapore were also lower, with heavier and sour crudes weakest. Arab Heavy dropped 10 cts to 16.63 dlrs a barrel and Dubai was off 12 cts to 18.09 dlrs. On the U.S. West Coast, however, netback values for ANS CIF L.A. were weaker with weak gasoline prices sending the yield at cracking plants down 68 cts to 18.42 dlrs from the previous Friday, as shown below in dlrs a barrel. TOPPING.........15.63......16.10......14.30 CRACKING........18.42......19.10......16.86 The Mediterranean region also showed netback values rising last Friday over the previous week with the largest gains shown by Es Sider and the heavier Urals crude oil, which were each up 22 cts a barrel last Friday to 19.40 dlrs and 19.16 dlrs a barrel, respectively. Netback values for the mediterranean region are shown below in dlrs a barrel.

Last week\\'s American Petroleum Institute report said that U.S. refining capacity rose three pct to 78.7 pct of capacity, with crude oil runs at 12.2 mln barrels per day for the week ended March 20. The API said that with the higher crude oil runs, distillate and gasoline inventories were sharply above year-ago levels. Gasoline stocks were at 245.6 mln barrels, some 17.2 mln barrels above year-ago levels. Distillate stocks, at 108.7 mln barrels, are 10.9 mln barrels above last year\\'s level, the API said. Henry Rosenberg, chairman of Crown Central Petroleum Corp &lt;CNP> told Reuters that unless refining and marketing return to profitability, oil companies will have to rely on downstream operations to produce an acceptable level of earnings. \"The jump in refining capacity is a concern if it continues,\" said Kenneth Buckler, executive vice president of refining and marketing at &lt;Total Petroleum Co>, a U.S. subsidiary of Cie Francaise Des Petroles of France. Refineries should operate near 75 pct of capacity given the current level of demand but the operating level should increase as gasoline demand picks up in the next quarter, Buckler said. Dunham said the potential operable capacity of U.S. refineries should also be cut about 500,000 barrels of crude per day. \"I expect to see the shutdown of more small refineries over the next five years,\" he said, adding that these facilities refine between 10,000 and 30,000 barrels of crude oil per day. The API said U.S. operations have the capacity to refine 15.6 mln bpd of crude. VENEZUELA WANTS TO BOOST ITS REFINING CAPACITY Venezuela\\'s state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. wants to raise its worldwide refining capacity by 150,000 barrels of per day, a company official attending the National Petroleum Refiners Association meeting here said. He declined to be identified but said PdVSA has the capacity to refine about 650,000 bpd of crude oil from refining centers in Venezuela, Sweden, West Germany, Belgium, and the United States. The company recently purchased a 50 pct stake in the Corpus Christi, Texas refinery of Champlin Petroleum Co, a subsidiary of Union Pacific Corp &lt;UNP>. Earlier it bought a similar stake in the Lake Charles, La refinery owned by Citgo Petroleum Corp, a unit of Southland Corp &lt;SLC>. According to the official, Venezuela is searching worldwide for the additional refining capacity but he did not mention where the company was looking. Refineries abroad, he said, guarantee a refining outlet for Venezuelan crude oil while ensuring stability of supply to refiners. He said Venezuela currently  produces about 1.4 mln bpd of crude oil, which is in line with its 1.495 bpd OPEC ceiling. SHELL CANADA SCHEDULES ANNUAL REFINERY SHUTDOWN Shell Canada Ltd, 72 pct owned by Royal Dutch/Shell Group &lt;RD> &lt;ST>, scheduled its annual maintenance refinery shutdowns during the next two months, company spokeswoman Judy Wish said. Wish said refineries will stockpile production before the shutdowns to maintain normal supply while maintenance is carried out. Production at Shell\\'s major refinery at Strathcona Alberta, will be closed for about one month, Wish said. There will be no layoffs associated with the refinery maintenance, she added. EXXON (XON) SEES SYNFUELS ROLE BY YEAR 2000 Development of costly shale oil, liquified coal and other kinds of synthetic fuels, halted in recent years because of cheap and abundant petroleum supplies, will become economic again when world oil prices top 30 dlrs a barrel, an Exxon Co USA executive said. Joe McMillan, a senior vice president, told Reuters after addressing a Houston meeting of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers, \"By early in the next century, synthetics should play a significant role in this country\\'s energy supply.\" McMillan also told reporters at a news conference that he believed synthetic fuels would become economic to develop when world oil prices reached a 30 to 40 dlr a barrel price range. \"You\\'re talking about a 50 pct increase in crude oil prices, but I think that time is coming and we\\'ve got to be prepared,\" McMillan said. He predicted U.S. oil demand would rise by about one pct annually in the next few years while the nation fails to replace its oil reserves through exploration. By the turn of the century, world oil prices will be significantly higher because of declining supplies, McMillan said. Ashland Oil, Inc. chairman John Hall, who also spoke at the meeting, advocated some form of federal tax incentives to help spur development of synthetic fuels. The United States, Hall said, has nearly 500 billion tons of demonstrated coal reserves, an amount more than triple that of all the world\\'s known oil reserves. \"We must encourage research now in order to make synfuels competitive later,\" Hall said. The average lead time for development of a shale oil or liquified coal project is between five and ten years. Until last year, the federal government had subsidized synfuels development through the U.S. Synthetic Fuels Corp., a research program created during the Carter Administration with the goal of developing replacements for up to two mln barrels of oil. The corporation was shut down last April when Congress refused to continue funding its eight billion dlr budget because of uneconomic projects based on forecasts of 50 dlrs a barrel oil and 10 dlr per mcf natural gas during this decade. U.S. SHOULD REASSESS MIDEAST POLICY - ANALYST The U.S. should reassess its Mideast policy in light of its rising dependence on imported oil, according to Charles Ebinger of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \"The prospect of rising dependence on oil imports from the Gulf, and the recent revelations of the Tower Commission report, mandate more than ever before the need for a fundamental reassessment of U.S. interests in the Middle East,\" Ebinger said. He remarks were made in an address to the National Petroleum Refiners Association meeting. \"Although in the short run it is difficult to see a direct link between Arab anger and threats to oil supplies, in the current environment it will be increasingly difficult for moderate Arab leaders to be seen as friendly to U.S. interests,\" Ebinger said. Oil traders said threats to oil supplies has kept crude oil prices strong recently although some believe prices will be weaker if demand falls in the spring. But William Randol, analyst at First Boston Corp, said crude oil prices will hold  near current levels this spring. There will be no spring downturn, said Randol, speaking at the annual refiner meeting. He said there is a 40 pct chance that crude oil prices could move higher in the second half of the year, following an OPEC meeting scheduled for late June. He said he expects OPEC will extend its current agreement to restrict production. OPEC will renew its production pricing agreement in June because the value of the oil exports of the OPEC producers  has declined along with the U.S. dollar, Randol said. OPEC oil exports are priced in U.S. dollars, and the dollar has fallen about 30 pct in the last 18 months. Randol said U.S. crude oil imports will increase 3.5 to four mln barrels per day by 1990 as consumption rises 1.5 to two mln bpd, and supplies decline two mln bpd. ANALYSTS APPLAUD CSR\\'S BOLD MOVE TO SELL DELHI CSR Ltd &lt;CSRA.S> has made a bold move in selling its oil and gas interests for almost a billion dlrs and ploughing 150 mln into its traditional sugar business, share analysts said. \"It sounds like a good deal,\" Stuart McKibbin of &lt;A.C. Goode and Co> told Reuters. CSR said it had dropped plans to float its oil and gas interests held in the &lt;Delhi Australia Fund> and would instead sell it to Exxon Corp &lt;XON> unit &lt;Esso Exploration and Production Australia Inc> for 985 mln dlrs. In a twin announcement CSR, already Australia\\'s largest sugar refiner, made a 2.20 dlr a share bid for the 70 pct it does not already hold in &lt;Pioneer Sugar Mills Ltd>. \"This will be a big shock to the market, which was under the impression that CSR was well down the road to floating Delhi,\" McKibbin said. A float of part of Delhi would have raised between 200 and 300 mln dlrs, but in opting to sell outright, CSR had given itself the cash to practically eliminate its debt and embark on an ambitious expansion programme in its best-performing divisions of sugar and building products, analysts said. CSR not only gets the 985 mln dlrs but also has the right to share equally with Esso any higher returns resulting from an oil price over 20 U.S. Dlrs a barrel in the next two years. Delhi is one of Australia\\'s largest onshore oil producers yielding about six mln barrels a year from the Cooper Basin. Analysts said the deal could net CSR as much as three mln dlrs for every dollar rise in the oil price above 20 dlrs. Neale Goldston-Morris of Sydney broker &lt;Bain and Co Ltd> said the move out of Delhi and investment in the sugar industry was a sensible one but added that it represented the loss of Australian-owned assets to a foreign company. \"The farm they bought back a few years ago is being sold back to the Americans,\" Goldston-Morris said. The Pioneer Sugar investment would make CSR by far the largest player in Australia\\'s 850 mln dlr a year sugar industry and would give it access to some of the best sugar properties and mills in the country, analysts said. They said Pioneer Sugar was expected to recommend acceptance of the bid through which CSR would benefit from the bottom out of a cyclical downturn in sugar prices. Sugar prices are forecast to rise to 340 dlrs a tonne next season from an estimated 270 dlrs this year, they said. Selling Delhi meant CSR has finally quit a damaging investment, made in 1981, which has dragged down the company\\'s overall performance, analysts said. CSR last year wrote off more than 550 mln dlrs in losses on what had been a 591 mln U.S. Dlr investment financed entirely from U.S. Dollar debt, they said. \"It was a bad investment for them. They financed it entirely with debt, the currency collapsed on them and then the oil price collapsed on them,\" Owen Evans of Sydney broker &lt;Meares and Philips Ltd> said. Esso not only picked up Delhi\\'s oil and gas output but also gained as much as 300 mln dlrs in transferable tax losses accumulated in exploration allowances and other concessions. Analysts said Esso also gained its first real onshore stake in Australia in its first major diversification from the 50/50 Bass Strait partnership with The Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd &lt;BRKN.S>. \"Esso has been very keen to diversify from the Gippsland Basin. They haven\\'t found too much oil in Bass Strait lately and Esso needed a large pool of ongoing production,\" Goldston-Morris said. CSR SELLS OIL/GAS INTERESTS, BIDS TO EXTEND SUGAR CSR Ltd has made a bold move in selling its oil and gas interests for almost a billion dlrs and ploughing 150 mln into its traditional sugar business, share analysts said. CSR said it had dropped plans to float its oil and gas interests held in the Delhi Australia Fund and would instead sell them to Exxon Corp unit Esso Exploration and Production Australia Inc for 985 mln dlrs. In a twin announcement CSR, already Australia\\'s largest sugar refiner, made a 2.20 dlr a share bid for the 70 pct it does not already hold in Pioneer Sugar Mills Ltd. A float of part of Delhi would have raised between 200 and 300 mln dlrs, but in opting to sell outright CSR had given itself the cash to all but eliminate its debt and embark on an ambitious expansion programme in its best-performing divisions of sugar and building products, analysts said. The Pioneer Sugar investment would give CSR by far the largest stake in Australia\\'s 850 mln dlr a year sugar industry and access to some of the best sugar properties and mills in the country, they said. Pioneer Sugar was expected to recommend acceptance of the bid, through which CSR would benefit from the bottoming out of a cyclical downturn in sugar prices. EXXON &lt;XON> OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION ROSE IN 1986 Exxon Corp said in its annual report that it raised production in 1986 although it did not replace all oil and gas produced. The company said that it added about four pct to production bringing it to 1.8 mln bpd, the highest level since 1979, based largely on increased production of oil overseas but additions to its reserves from new discoveries and reserve acquisitions did not replace all of the oil and gas produced. The company said that the average price for oil and gas declined 41 pct in 1986 from the previous year sparking a 38 pct decline in its earnings from exploration and production. Exxon\\'s earnings from exploration and production in 1986 fell to 3.1 billion dlrs from 4.9 billion dlrs in 1985. Exxon said that its principal gains in production came from the Gulf of Mexico, Alaska, the North Sea, Malaysia and from oil sands in Canada. Exxon also said that it acquired 11.2 mln acres for expoloration spread over 10 countries including the U.S, Europe and the Far East. But capital expenditures for exploration and production were cut to 4.6 billion dlrs from 7.6 billion the previous year and further reductions were expected in 1987. Exxon said that its net share of crude oil and natural gas liquids produced from offshore fields in the North Sea reached a new high of 422,000 bpd. The light, sweet crudes produced from these North Sea fields also gave the company trading gains as Exxon was able to sell much of this crude and replace it with cheaper, lower quality crude oil for its refineries which have been upgraded over the past several years. The trading gains and lower acquisition costs gave Exxon more of a spread in its refinery operations and added to earnings gains from refining and marketing. Exxon said earnings from refining and marketing operations rose to nearly two billion dlrs in 1986, up from 872 mln dlrs in 1985. The company said petroleum sales slipped slightly to 4.043 mln barrels per day from 4.082 mln bpd in 1985 while crude runs rose to 3.0 mln bpd from 2.9 mln bpd the previous year. Exxon\\'s refinery operations benefited from a three year 500 mln dlr upgrading program to its Baytown, Texas refinery completed last October and an 850 mln dlr upgrading project in Rotterdam both of which emphasize utilizing lower grade crudes to extract higher proportions of light products. EXXON &lt;XON> GAINS DUE TO STREAMLINED OPERATIONS Exxon Corp said that 1986\\'s 15 pct increase in earnings per share to 7.42 dlrs a share were partially based on its streamlined operations which compensated for the weakness in its exploration earnings and the lowest crude oil prices in a decade. Exxon said economies introduced in its operations from reductions in personnel and other savings, such as reductions in exploration expenses, were reflected in an 880 mln dlr reduction in consolidated operating costs from 1985. The company said its more efficient operations would be necessary to offset more adverse oil market conditions ahead. The company also said that its share repurchase plan contributed to the per share gains over 1985. In a breakdown of costs, Exxon said that operating expenses slipped to 9.2 billion dlrs in 1986 from 9.7 billion dlrs the previous year and exploration expenses, including dry holes, slipped back to 1.2 billion dlrs from 1.5 billion dlrs over the same period as the number of wells drilled was lower. The company was also able to use lower interest rates to reduce its interest expenses to 614 mln dlrs in 1986 from 627 mln dlrs the previous year. Exxon said that the ratio of debt to capital was cut by 1.6 pct in 1986 from the previous year to 19 pct. On December 31, 1986 Exxon\\'s total debt of 7.87 billion dlrs was down slightly from the previous year\\'s 7.9 billion dlrs and long term debt stood at 4.3 billion dlrs, down from 4.8 billion dlrs in 1985. Exxon\\'s policy of repurchasing shares on the market for its treasury also contributed to earnings results by a reduction of shares to 722.6 mln shares from 754.1 mln shares the previous year. CHEVRON &lt;CHV>, NIPPON OIL FORM JOINT VENTURE Chevron Corp said its Chevron U.S.A. Inc unit and Tokyo-based Nippon Oil Co Ltd agreed to conduct a joint-venture oil exploration and development program on selected Chevron leaseholds in the United States. About 50 onshore and offshore exploratory wells will be drilled under the agreement and Chevron will be the operator of the project and pay some costs, the company said. It said Nippon will contribute an initial investment of more than 100 mln dlrs. The Japanese government will also participate in the venture by providing financing to Nippon through the Japanese Oil Corp, Chevron said. It said drilling will begin during the second quarter. Properties to be evaluated are located in California, Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma, Mississippi, Montana, North Dakota, Texas, Utah, and Wyoming, along with Federal Outer Continental Shelf leases offshore Southern California and in the Gulf of Mexico, Chevron said. TREASURY\\'S BAKER SAYS REAGAN UNLIKELY TO ALTER OPPOSITION TO OIL IMPORT FEE TREASURY\\'S BAKER SAYS REAGAN UNLIKELY TO ALTER OPPOSITION TO OIL IMPORT FEE TREASURY\\'S BAKER SEES REAGAN OPPOSING OIL TAX Treasury Secretary James Baker told the House Appropriations Committee that he believes the president remains opposed to an oil import fee. He said Reagan last year rejected the idea and he added: \"In my personal view he is not likely to change his thinking on that.\" He said Reagan last year opposed the idea because the energy industry was divided on the issue, a tax would require a new bureacracy to administer and the resulting higher energy prices would harm U.S. competitiveness. U.S. OFFICIALS DEFEND OIL RESERVE SALE PLAN Treasury Secretary James Baker and Office of Management and Budget chief James Miller defended an administration plan to sell the U.S. Naval Petroleum Reserves. In response to hostile questioning from a member of the House Appropriations Committee, the officials said the plan was justified to help bring the fiscal 1988 budget deficit and to get the government out of the oil business. Miller acknowleged the estimated sale proceeds at 3.3 billion dlrs would actually bring down the deficit by about 2.2 billion dlrs because of the loss of revenues from the sale of oil from the reserves. Miller said the sale price may end up higher. \"We\\'d sell it to the highest bidder,\" Miller said. \"If we can get more we\\'ll take it.\" U.S. DISTILLATE, GASOLINE INVENTORIES SEEN LOWER Tonight\\'s American Petroleum Institute weekly inventory report is expected to show moderate drawdowns in distillates and gasoline stocks for the week ended March 27, analysts and traders said. They said they expect gasoline stocks to fall three mln barrels or less and heating oil inventories to drop between 1.3 and four mln barrels. Some analysts see crude stocks falling by as much as six mln barrels, while others think they could go up as much as 3.5 mln barrels. Crude oil runs are expected to be unchanged from the previous week or slightly higher or lower. For the week ended March 20, the API said gasoline stocks fell 2.7 mln barrels. Mosts analysts expect a modest draw for the week ended March 27. They said stocks could fall between 700,000 and three mln barrels. Some said there is also a chance gasoline stocks will be unchanged. API said distillate stocks dropped four mln barrels for the week ended March 20. Analysts and traders generally predict a similar or smaller depletion for last week. They said stock levels could drop 1.3 to four mln barrels. The analysts attribute product stockdraws to seasonal factors but they said crude direction is harder to call. Crude inventories rose 8.5 mln barrels in the week ended March 20, API said. Analysts are looking for build of between 3.5 mln barrels to a six mln barrel draw for the week ended March 27. API reported the amount of refinery capacity utilized up three pct for the week ended March 20. Analysts said utilization could have remained unchanged, or rose or fell by less than one pct for the week ended March 27. Moderate product stockdraws would strengthen the market slightly, analysts said. But bullish expectations are already partially reflected in today\\'s gains, they added. UNION PACIFIC &lt;UNP>CLOSES VENEZUELAN PARTNERSHIP Union Pacific Corp said it has closed the previously announced 50-50 partnership with Petroleos de Venezuela SA, Venezuela\\'s national oil company, to own a 160,000 barrel per day refinery in Corpus Christi, Texas. Union Pacific said the partnership, called Champlin Refining Co, will acquire the refining and distribution system owned and operated by Union Pacific\\'s Champlin Petroleum Co subsidiary. The Venezuelan company also signed a 25-year feedstock agreement with the partnership to supply at least 140,000 barrels a day of Venezuelan crude oil and naphtha at market related prices. DEVON &lt;DIN> REPORTS INCREASE IN RESERVES Devon Resource Investors said as of January one, its estimated proven reserves increased by 443,000 net equivalent barrels to 32.4 billion cubic feet of natural gas and 660,000 barrels of oil, compared with 29.5 bcf of gas and 700,500 barrels of oil as of Jan one, 1986. Devon said that its estimated future net revenues attributable to reserves is about 58 mln dlrs with a present value, discounted at 10 pct, of 38 mln dlrs. It also said that it expects to have sufficient cash flow to cover its annual payout of 60 ct per unit and expand its drilling budget in 1987. IMPERIAL OIL &lt;IMO.A> IN TALKS WITH SUPPLIERS Imperial Oil Ltd, 70 pct-owned by Exxon Corp &lt;XON>, is negotiating with it major crude oil suppliers concerning the effects of a trial deregulation of Alberta\\'s shut-in crude oil production, scheduled to be implemented on June 1, a company spokesman said. \"From our point of view, it\\'s a question of entering into negotiations or discussions to make appropriate changes to contracts to reflect the changes that are going to take place on June 1,\" spokesman John Cote told Reuters in reply to a query. Commenting on published reports that Imperial had suspended its oil supply contracts, Cote said: \"It\\'s not a question of cancelling or suspending any of the agreements at this point.\" On June 1, Alberta\\'s Energy Resources Conservation Board will lift its crude oil marketing prorationing system, regulating shut-in light and medium crude production, on a trial basis to the end of 1987. Under the new system, producers and refiners will be allowed to negotiate volumes of shut-in oil to be delivered under purchase contracts. Shut-in crude is the surplus between the total amount of oil being produced and the amount being purchased by refiners. \"We have talked to a number of our major suppliers, and we\\'ve discussed the upcoming change with them, but nothing has been finalized,\" Imperial\\'s manager of western crude supply Gary Strong said. Under Alberta\\'s trial system, Imperial wants to match a reasonable supply of crude against the company\\'s forecast demand for its refineries, Strong said. \"We have to know what they have and how that relates to what we need in total,\" he said. Strong said figures on the amount of crude production Imperial purchases from outside suppliers were not immediately available. API SAYS DISTILLATE STOCKS OFF 2.52 MLN BBLS, GASOLINE OFF 260,000, CRUDE OFF 4.23 MLN API SAYS DISTILLATE STOCKS OFF 2.52 MLN BBLS, GASOLINE OFF 260,000, CRUDE OFF 4.23 MLN OIL PRICES SAID NOW BASED ON FUTURES PRICE Energy futures now set the standard for oil pricing, said Arnold Safer, president of The Energy Futures Group Inc, a consulting firm. \"Petroleum futures trading at the New York Mercantile Exchange literally set spot market prices in the U.S.,\" he said, adding that some oil products sellers now offer contracts based on a daily average of NYMEX prices. He also said that petroleum futures are a major market for oil companies as well as for commodity traders. His remarks were made at the National Petroleum Refiners Association.

The Buena Vista light grade, at 26 degrees api gravity, was raised 1.35 dlrs a barrel to 15.55 dlrs/bbl, while the Huntington Beach light grade, at 16 degrees, was raised about 1.75 dlrs/bbl to 14.10 dlrs/bbl. The heavier Wilmington grade, at 17 degrees, was increased 1.20 dlrs to 14.30 dlrs/bbl. Kern River crude, at 13 degrees, was increased 1.00 dlr to 13.00 dlrs/bbl. Mobil also said that effective today it changed its gravity adjustment scale as follows: From 20 degrees to 34 degrees API, Mobil will adjust its price 0.015 of a ct per one-tenth of an API degree. Below 20 degrees API, the company will adjust its price 0.020 ct per one-tenth of a degree. Crude grades from 34 degrees API to above 40 degrees are unaffected. 1-APR-1987 18:11:48.24 1-APR-1987 18:11:48.24 NP ENERGY &lt;NPEEQ> SAYS TRUSTEE APPOINTED NP Energy Corp said the U.S. Bankruptcy Court has indicated it will appoint a trustee to oversee the company\\'s Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings. It said it hopes the appointment will thwart \"hostile\" actions being pursued by two unsecured creditors to whose claims the company objects. NP further said the Nielsen 1-20 well in Duchesne County, Utah, has tested 300 barrels of oil per day.  NP owns a 61 pct working interest. MADRID METRO HALTED AS SPANISH STRIKES SPREAD An estimated 1.2 mln metro users in Madrid were stranded today as striking railway workers halted the underground transport system, industry sources said. The strikers joined coal miners, steel and oil refinery workers in Spain\\'s latest wave of stoppages over wage demands. Some 10,000 pitmen in the northern province of Leon entered the second day of an indefinite stoppage to demand wage rises and a five-day working week, the sources said. Oil refinery workers picketed the state-owned Empresa Nacional de Petroleo SA (EMP) to prevent fuel lorries leaving the company\\'s largest plant in Puertollano, central Spain. Paramilitary police were guarding steel mills at Reinosa, in northern Spain, from the daily protests against planned job cuts. A local government official said the police force would remain in place until tempers had cooled down. More than 60 people were injured in pitched battles between police and steel foundry workers in Reinosa last month. DIAMOND SHAMROCK (DIA) CUTS CRUDE PRICES Diamond Shamrock Corp said that effective today it had cut its contract prices for crude oil by 1.50 dlrs a barrel. The reduction brings its posted price for West Texas Intermediate to 16.00 dlrs a barrel, the copany said. \"The price reduction today was made in the light of falling oil product prices and a weak crude oil market,\" a company spokeswoman said. Diamond is the latest in a line of U.S. oil companies that have cut its contract, or posted, prices over the last two days citing weak oil markets. CLOSURE OF BP SWEDEN REFINERY FORECAST A Swedish Finance Ministry committee forecast that British Petroleum Plc &lt;BP.L> may have to close its refinery in Gothenburg because of an anticipated worsening of the Swedish petroleum industry\\'s competitiveness. It said in a report that the future of the Swedish refining business was bleak due to the steady drop in domestic oil consumption since the mid-1970s, a possible tightening of rules on sulphur content and competition from Norway\\'s Mongstad facility of &lt;Den Norske Stats Olieselskab> (Statoil) &lt;STAT.OL> when its expansion is completed in the 1990s. The committee said the BP refinery, which lacks a de-sulphurisation plant, was likely to be closed or sold unless costly investments were made to enhance the facility\\'s capacity to refine a broader range of products. But the committee noted that capacity utilisation had in recent years been above that of the European refining industry on average. The BP plant, in which Sweden\\'s state-owned &lt;OK Petroleum AB> has a 22 pct, started up in 1967 and has an annual capacity of 4.7 mln tonnes. There was nobody at British Petroleum immediately available for comment. NORSK HYDRO, SAGA SEEK DRILLING RIGHTS IN GABON Norwegian oil companies Norsk Hydro A/S &lt;NHY.OL> and Saga Petroleum A/S &lt;SAGO.OL> said they have applied for offshore exploration drilling licenses in Gabon on Africa\\'s west coast. Saga Petroleum said it has applied for a 35 pct share and operatorship on one block, adding Finnish oil company Neste &lt;NEOY.HE>(25 pct), Spain\\'s Hispanoil (25 pct), and the World Bank\\'s International Finance Corporation (IFS) (15 pct) have joined Saga to fill remaining shares in the application. Saga spokesman Roy Halvorsen told Reuters he expected Gabonese officials would reply to the application by Easter. Halvorsen said this is the first time Saga has applied to operate on OPEC-member Gabon\\'s continental shelf, adding that Italian oil company Agip is heading a group of applicants in a separate bid for the same license. Norsk Hydro has also applied for an undisclosed share in a single exploration license in which U.S. Oil company Tenneco has already been assigned operatorship, company spokesman Bjoern Tretvoll said. BP SAYS NO PLANS TO CLOSE SWEDISH REFINERY The British Petroleum Co Plc &lt;BP.L> said it had no plans to close its refinery in Gothenburg, despite forecasts by a Swedish finance ministry committee that it might be planning such a move. The committee said the refinery\\'s future looked bleak because the Swedish petroleum industry\\'s competitiveness was expected to worsen unless it invested, and because of the effects of a possible tightening of rules on sulphur content. But BP said the unit, in which Sweden\\'s &lt;OK Petroleum AB> has a 22 pct stake, had performed well both technically and financially up to and including the first quarter of 1987. Current restrictions on sulphur emissions and known future plans for both Sweden and export markets did not cause it any serious problems, it said in a statement. The refinery started up in 1967 and has an annual capacity of 4.7 mln tonnes. OIL PRICES RISE ON SAUDI EFFORT Crude oil prices rallied today, moving over 17.00 dlrs a barrel because of Saudi Arabia\\'s determined effort to support prices, analysts said. \"The Saudis and other OPEC nations are jawboning the market, hoping to restore confidence and prices and to do this without another meeting,\" said Sanford Margoshes, oil analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. \"But OPEC is not out of the woods yet by a longshot due to seasonal declines in demand and some cheating,\" he added. Oil industry analysts said Saudi Arabia has led the attempt to get other OPEC members to resist pressures to discount from the official prices agreed to last december. The analysts said that to get others to hold the line, Saudi Arabia pushed hard at the meeting of deputy oil ministers of the Gulf Cooperation Council last weekend and at the Cooperation Council oil ministers\\' meeting the previous week. The Saudis have also offered to support members having difficulty in selling their oil, analysts said. \"They are trying to make sure that no one discounts, and to prevent that, it appears that Saudi Arabia or some other OPEC member will allocate some of their oil sales to help members that lose sales,\" Margoshes said. He added that the allocations would probably be in the form of loans to be repaid when these nations resume sales. Analysts said this would be useful in keeping in line nations like Qatar, which has had trouble selling oil. But it is also likely that such assistance would be provided to Nigeria which is under pressure to extend discounts. Analysts said that Saudi Arabia, with assistance from OPEC president Rilwanu Lukman, was trying to avoid an emergency OPEC meeting for fear that it would give the appearance that the December pact is falling apart. Daniel McKinley, oil analyst with Smith Barney, Upham Harris and Co said, \"both physical and futures markets have been oversold and it only took a small spark to bring on a short covering rally.\" He believes an Iranian trade mission to Tokyo, which refused discounts to Japanese buyers, brought Japanese refiners into the market to cover their short positions. Oil traders said one japanese refiner came into the market to but 10 cargoes of May Dubai, which sent prices up on Mideast sours, with Dubai trading up to 16.50 dlrs after trading yeterray as low as 15.63 dlrs and then spilled over into the North sea crude oil market. Traders said that there have been persistent rumors today that Japanese buyers are looking to pick up cargoes of Brent for Japan and European trade sources indidate rumors of vessels being fixed to make such shipments. North sea brent today rose over 17.00 dlrs with trades reported as high as 17.05 dlrs, up one dlr. OPEC members\\' denials that they are producing over their quotas sparked moves to cover short postitions. Indonesian oil minister Subroto said today that OPEC production was below the 15.8 mln bpd quota agreed to last december but he gave no details on OPEC production against claims it was more at least one mln bpd above that level. \"The production probably is about their quota level and largely because Saudi Arabia will not discount and canot sell its oil as a result,\" Margoshes said. Analysts have mixed opinions about the extent of the current rally. Some believe prices can continue to rise if Saudi Arabia and OPEC hold steady in a refusal to discount. But others said that despite the rally today there were still several fundamental factors, including demand, which could cut the rally short. Marion Stewart, an indepedent petroleum economist, said slow growth in the economies of the U.S. and OECD would keep demand for oil slack and he now estimates that demand to rise about 1.4 pct over 1986. BRAZIL TO BUY 30,000 BPD OF KUWAITI OIL Brazil will import 30,000 barrels per day of crude oil from Kuwait, a spokesman for the state oil company Petrobras said. He said that, unlike Saudi Arabia, Kuwait did not impose any conditions on Brazil. Last month, Petrobras cancelled a 40-mln dlr oil purchase from Saudi Arabia after the Saudis refused to accept credit guarantees from the official Bank of Brazil. The Saudis eventually lifted the condition and Brazil decided to reconfirm the purchase. Brazil currently consumes 1.1 mln barrels of oil per day. TEXAS PETROLEUM ACQUIRES OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES Texas Petroleum Corp said it issued 14.4 mln shares of restricted common stock in exchange for oil and gas properties and joint ventures located in the U.S. and overseas. The properties were acquired from &lt;North American Oil and Gas Corp> and Texas Petroleum Corp in Canada, the company said. It added the acquisitions were the first step toward creating an oil and gas exploration and development enterprise. CANADA OIL INDUSTRY SET FOR RECOVERY - ANALYSTS Firmer crude oil prices, government aid packages and corporate spending cuts will help Canada\\'s oil industry recover from last year sharp downturn, industry analysts said. They said there will be significant earnings gains in 1987 compared to last year\\'s dismal results when oil prices dropped about 50 pct. On Canada\\'s stock exchanges, energy shares have soared to their highest levels since 1983, with many issues trading at record highs. \"This is reflecting a tremendous amount of optimism on the part of the investment community that the outlook for the industry for the future is extremely attractive,\" Peters and Co Ltd oil analyst Wilf Gobert said. Financial statements from Canada\\'s major oil companies, culminating with Dome Petroleum Ltd\\'s 2.20 billion Canadian dlr 1986 loss reported this week, painted a bleak picture of last year\\'s results, analysts said. \"But the financial statements are a snap shot and a recording of history. The stock market is the indication of the future,\" Gobert commented. The Toronto Stock Exchange\\'s oil and gas index of 41 companies is up to 4065.4 so far in trading today from 3053.15 at the end of 1986. Among Canada\\'s largest oil companies, class A shares of Imperial Oil Ltd &lt;IMO.A>, 70 pct owned by Exxon Corp &lt;XON>, is trading at 71, up from a 52-week low of 34-3/4. Shell Canada Ltd, 72 pct owned by Royal Dutch/Shell Group, is at 40-1/2, up from a low during the last year of 18-3/4. Texaco Canada Inc &lt;TXC>, 78 pct owned by Texaco Inc &lt;TX>, is at 34-7/8, up from a low of 24-1/2. Levesque Beaubien Inc oil analyst Robert Plexman forecasts operating profit for 10 of Canada\\'s largest oil and gas companies will rise 37 pct in 1987 to about 1.44 billion dlrs and operating cash flow will increase 12 pct to 3.24 billion dlrs, based on an average oil price for the year of 16.50 U.S. dlrs a barrel. \"However, if prices hold about 18 U.S. dlrs a barrel...1987 net operating income could show a 69 pct increase with cash flow 27 pct higher,\" analyst Plexman said. \"Although it is difficult to forecast the extent of the profit improvement this year, the gain should be significant,\" he added. Those improvements follow a sharp downturn in 1986, when operating income for the ten companies dropped 47 pct to 1.05 billion dlrs and operating cash flow fell 22 pct to 2.90 billion dlrs. But one industry source doesn\\'t think oil prices will hold recent gains and more government assistance is needed. Canadian Petroleum Association technical director Hans Maciej sees industry cash flow falling another 10 pct in 1987, after dipping about 60 pct last year. Maciej said he sees crude oil supply outweighing demand and doesn\\'t believe a recent OPEC production accord will continue to support prices. However, several companies share the optimistic industry outlook expressed by a majority of analysts. Shell Canada and &lt;Norcen Energy Resources Ltd> forecast improved 1987 earnings in their annual reports issued this week, assuming oil prices remain at or above 1986 levels. \"The industry\\'s outlook for 1987 is positive, but not robust,\" Texaco Canada said in its annual report. \"While oil prices have strengthened somewhat and there is good reason to believe that the general level is sustainable, continued volatility is likely,\" Texaco Canada added. In the face of short-term uncertainty, many companies have pared 1987 spending plans from last year\\'s lower levels, deferring most frontier exploration work. \"The industry is becoming very selective in investments, very conservative and cautious, which is not unexpected,\" Canadian Petroleum Association\\'s Maciej said. Federal and Alberta goverment aid measures helped cushion the industry downturn in 1986 and are improving 1987 results. The most significant help came last September when the federal government lifted the 10 pct Petroleum Gas Revenue Tax (PGRT) 28 months earlier then planned. Analysts estimate the tax relief will save larger oil companies about 1.50 billion dlrs by the end of 1988. The PGRT cut helped brake the steep profit and cash flow decline in 1986 for many oil companies and prevented further exploration spending cuts, analysts said. \"For a number of companies, the PGRT cut was absolutely necessary to even maintain the kind of reduced investments that were made, otherwise the reduction would have been considerably more,\" Maciej said. PETROBRAS SEES RAISING EXPORT OF FUEL IN 1987 Brazil\\'s state oil company Petrobras is pledging to export 4.6 mln cubic meters of fuel, or 28.9 mln barrels in 1987, a company spokesman said. He said that represents a total sale worth 600 mln dlrs. The volume is 27 pct higher over 1986 sales, which totalled 3.6 mln cubic meters, or 22.6 mln barrels. The United States, Africa and Latin American are Brazil\\'s main fuel buyers, the spokesman said. COLOMBIA\\'S MAIN OIL PIPELINE ATTACKED State-run oil company Ecopetrol said Colombia\\'s main oil pipeline was bombed again and pumping of 170,000 barrels per day was suspended. A spokeswoman for the company said that the early morning dynamite attack was the 31st in the last nine months on the Cano Limon-Covenas pipeline, which links Colombia\\'s biggest oilfied at Cravo Norte to the Caribbean. She said about 2,000 barrels of crude were spilled and could not indicate when pumping would resume. The attack was near Magangue in northeastern Bolivar province. Ecopetrol is exploiting Cravo Norte in association with Occidental Petroleum Corp &lt;OXY> and Shell Petroleum N.V., a unit of the Royal Dutch/Shell Group &lt;RD> &lt;ST>. Ecopetrol said in a communique that bombings since last July led to a loss of more than 110,000 barrels of crude, or the equivalent of 10 mln dlrs. BRAZIL MAKES SECOND AMAZON OIL DISCOVERY The Brazilian state oil company Petrobras has made a second oil discovery in the Amazon region, President Jose Sarney said. He said the well had an initial flow of 150,000 cubic meters of gas and 220 barrels of oil per day. It is situated 14 kilometres from the first well to be discovered in the region last year, which is currently yielding 500,000 cubic meters of gas and 900 barrels of oil daily. The wells, the biggest onshore well in the country, are on the banks of the river Uruc in the Amazon basin 3,600 kilometres (2,250 miles) north of Brasilia. PANCANADIAN TO SELL NORTH SEA PROPERTIES, UNIT TO WHITEHALL FOR CASH PANCANADIAN TO SELL NORTH SEA PROPERTIES, UNIT TO WHITEHALL FOR CASH IEA SEES ONE PCT GROWTH IN 1987 OECD OIL DEMAND Growth in oil consumption in the Western industrialised countries is likely to slow to around one pct this year compared with 2.3 pct in 1986, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said. Oil use in the 24 countries of the OECD increased by around one pct in first quarter 1987 to 35.9 mln bpd, the IEA said in its Monthly Oil Market Report. Growth in OECD countries is expected to come primarily from transport fuels, as in 1986. But if average consumer prices are higher than 1986, the rate of growth for these fuels may be below last year\\'s 3.6 pct, it said. The IEA said that assuming crude oil and product prices stay close to current levels, some destocking by end-users can be expected. If that happens, natural gas will also regain some of the market share it lost to heavy fuel in 1986, and there may be slightly less growth in transport fuels. IEA estimates on April 1 put oil stocks in the OECD area at 428 mln tonnes, representing 98 days of forward consumption. This is about the same level as at the begining of the year. The agency said this flat trend is explained by the projected seasonal consumption decline in the second quarter of the year which offset a reduction in stocks. It said initial estimates indicate that company stocks fell by 1.2 mln bpd in OECD countries in the first quarter of the year. This followed a small rise in January of 0.4 mln bpd but a decline of 1.5 mln bpd in February and 2.5 mln bpd in March. It is possible that final data will show a larger draw, particulary for March, it said. As crude production also fell, there is likely to have also been a decline in non-reported stocks, particularly at sea, the IEA said. Company stocks on land in the OECD rose to 326 mln tonnes on April 1 against 316 mln on April 1 1986. Governments built up strategic stocks to 102 mln tonnes against 97 mln in the period. The year-on-year trend of government stock building is continuing with year-on-year company stocks also rising, more or less in line with consumption, after declining for five years, the IEA noted. Oil stocks on land in the U.S. And Canada were put at 206.6 mln tonnes on April 1, down from the 214 mln tonnes on January 1 and equivalent to 94 and 98 days of consumption, respectively. Oil stocks in Western Europe were 147.4 mln tonnes on April 1, down from the 154 mln on January 1 but still equivalent to 94 days of consumption. World oil supply fell in the first quarter by about two mln bpd to 45.2 mln bpd from 47.2 mln bpd in last quarter 1986. This drop was mostly due to a decline in OPEC crude production to around 15.5 mln bpd in February/March from 16.5 mln bpd in January and to the seasonal drop in exports from centrally-planned Economies, the IEA said. Total OPEC crude oil supply was 15.8 mln bpd in the first quarter, plus 1.4 mln bpd of NGLs, compared with 17.3 mln bpd of crude in the last three months of 1986 and 17.9 mln average for the whole of 1986. Supply from non-OPEC countries totalled 28 mln bpd, against 28.5 mln bpd in the fourth quarter 1986. A drop in Saudi Arabian output to a tentatively forecast 3.3 mln bpd in March from 3.6 mln bpd in February was the largest factor behind the OPEC production decline, the IEA said. Saudi Arabia\"s Opec-assigned output quota is 4.133 mln bpd. IEA FORECASTS SLOWER GROWTH IN OECD OIL DEMAND Growth in oil consumption in the Western industrialized countries is likely to slow to around one pct this year compared with 2.3 pct in 1986, the International Energy Agency said. Oil use in the 24 member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) increased by around one pct in the first quarter of 1987 to 35.9 mln barrels a day, the IEA said in its latest monthly report. Growth in OECD countries is expected to come primarily from transport fuels, as was the case in 1986. But if average consumer prices are higher than 1986, the rate of growth for these fuels may be below last year\\'s 3.6 pct. The IEA said assuming crude and product prices remain nar current levels, some destocking by end-users can be expected. If that takes place, natural gas will also regain some of the market share it lost to heavy fuel in 1986, it said. IEA estimates on April one put oil stocks held in the OECD area at 428 mln tonnes, or 98 days of forward consumption. This is about the same as at the begining of the year. The agency said this flat trend is explained by the projected seasonal consumption decline in the second quarter of the year which offset a reduction in stocks. Company stocks on land in the OECD rose to 326 mln tonnes on April one this year compared with 316 mln tonnes in calender 1986 while governments also built up their strategic stocks to 102 mln tonnes against 97 mln in 1986. The year-on-year trend of government stock building is continuing with company stocks rising, more or less in line with consumption, after declining for five years, IEA said. Oil stocks on land in the United States and Canada were put at 206.6 mln tonnes down from the 214 mln tonnes on January one and equivalent to 94 and 98 days of consumption, respectively. Oil stocks in Western Europe were 147.4 mln tonnes, down from the 154 mln tonnes on January one but still equivalent to 94 days of consumption. The IEA said that initial estimates indicate that company stocks fell by 1.2 mln bpd in OECD countries in the first quarter of the year. This followed a small rise in January of 400,000 bpd but a decline of 1.5 bpd in February and 2.5 bpd in March. And it is possible that final data will show a larger draw, particulary for March, it said. As crude production also fell, there is likely to have also been a decline in non-reported stocks, particularly at sea, the IEA said. World oil supply fell through the first quarter by about two bpd to 45.2 bpd from 47.5 bpd in the last quarter of 1986. This drop was mostly due to a decline in OPEC crude production to around 15.5 bpd in February/March from 16.5 bpd in January and to the seasonal drop in exports from Centrally Planned Economies, the IEA said. Total OPEC oil supply totalled 17.2 bpd in the first quarter of 1987 compare with 19.3 bpd in the last three months of 1986 while supply from non-OPEC countries totalled 28 bpd as against 28.2 bpd in the same 1986 period. A drop in Saudi Arabian output to a tentatively forecast 3.3 bpd in march from 3.6 bpd in February was the largest factor behind the OPEC production decline, the IEA said. API SAYS DISTILLATE STOCKS OFF 4.4 MLN BBLS, GASOLINE OFF 30,000, CRUDE UP 700,000 API SAYS DISTILLATE STOCKS OFF 4.4 MLN BBLS, GASOLINE OFF 30,000, CRUDE UP 700,000 PANCANADIAN TO SELL BRITISH INTERESTS &lt;PanCanadian Petroleum Ltd> said it agreed to sell its working interest in its North Sea properties and its British unit, Canadian Pacific Oil and Gas of Canada Ltd, to Whitehall Petroleum Ltd, a private British company. PanCanadian, 87 pct-owned by Canadian Pacific Ltd &lt;CP>, said it would receive 1.7 mln British pounds cash (3.5 mln Canadian dlrs) at closing, expected in two to three months. It said the deal is subject to approval by regulators and its partners in the properties, which consist of exploration wells. It will also retain a royalty interest in the properties. API SAYS DISTILLATE, GAS STOCKS OFF IN WEEK Distillate fuel stocks held in primary storage fell by 4.4 mln barrels in the week ended Feb 27 to 127.10 mln barrels from 131.50 mln the previous week, the American Petroleum Institute (API) said. In its weekly statistical bulletin, the oil industry trade group said gasoline stocks fell 30,000 barrels to 252.92 mln barrels from a revised 252.95 mln, while crude oil stocks rose 700,000 barrels to 329.38 mln from a revised 328.68 mln. It said residual fuel stocks fell 380,000 barrels to 38.04 mln from 38.42 mln barrels. API said refinery runs in the week fell to 12.17 mln barrels per day from a revised 12.42 mln and refinery use of operating capacity was 78.1 pct, off from a revised 79.7 pct. Crude oil imports in the week fell to 3.98 mln bpd from a revised 4.22 mln, API added. KUWAIT MAY RE-REGISTER GULF TANKERS - NEWSPAPER Kuwait may re-register part of its tanker fleet with foreign flag jurisdictions, including the U.S. And USSR, in an attempt to protect them from Iranian missile attacks in the Gulf war zone, U.S. Officials were quoted by the New York Times as saying. The transfers would allow the country of registration to escort Kuwaiti-owned ships in the Gulf. Kuwait had earlier declined an offer of U.S. Naval escorts as too public an admission of its need for protection, they said. Kuwait is also looking at flagging-out to European registries, the officials said. Soviet flag tankers transporting Kuwaiti oil through the Gulf may get Soviet escorts, the officials said. Kuwait had earlier considered having both USSR and U.S. Escorts, but the U.S. Was unwilling to give the Soviet Union a naval role in the region, the newspaper quoted the officials as saying. Kuwait has backed Iraq in the seven-year war against Iran and its ships have increasingly been the target of Iranian attacks. The U.S. And Kuwait have been negotiating for over a month on methods of protecting Kuwaiti ships. OCCIDENTAL &lt;OXY> IN BIG PERU HEAVY OIL FIND Occidental Petroleum Corp said the Shiviyacu-23 development well on Block 1-AB in the Peruvian Amazon jungle is producing 6,593 barrels of 22 degree gravity oil per day from depths of 9,543 to 9,547 and 9,556 to 9,599 feet. The company said it is drilling a new exploration well on the block, Southeast Shiviyacu-1, 2.5 miles away. BP SCOTTISH REFINERY SET TO RESTART THIS WEEK The British Petroleum &lt;BP.L> Co Plc\\'s refinery at Grangemouth, Scotland, shut down after an explosion and fire in the hydrocracker on March 22, will probably be back in operation towards the week-end, a refinery spokesman said. He said the refinery will resume at about half its 178,500 barrels per day (bpd) capacity, as work on overhauling the North Side of the complex, which began at the end of January, will not be completed before the end of April. He said the refinery had been closed for longer than originally expected due to the lengthy safety checks being carried out prior to restarting. The explosion and fire, in which one worker was killed, caused extensive damage to the central part of the 32,000 hydrocracker and the spokesman said today this unit would be out of operation for several months. The remainder of the refinery, including the 19,000 catalytic cracker, was undamaged. He said inquiries into the accident, which happened while the hydrocracker was not in operation, were continuing. In an earlier incident, two people were killed in an explosion and fire at the refinery on March 13. SAUDI SUCCESS SEEN IN CURBING OPEC PRODUCTION Saudi Arabia will succeed in pressuring other members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to stay within their production quotas, said Morgan Stanley Group managing director John Wellemeyer. Wellemeyer, speaking to reporters at an offshore oil engineering conference, also said he expected OPEC nations to attempt to hold prices under 20 dlrs a barrel for several years to keep industrial demand for residual fuel oil strong. \"Over the next few weeks I think you\\'ll see a concerted effort by the Saudis to get production down,\" Wellemeyer said. \"The Saudis are committed to that price level (of 18 dlrs a barrel) and are willing to make it happen again,\" he said. In recent weeks, oil prices fell to the 16 to 17 dlrs a barrel level on market reports of some OPE members producing above their quota, pushing total OPEC production to 15.8 mln barrels per day. But prices rebounded today, with April U.S. crude prices up about one dlr to over 17 dlrs a barrel on a belief Saudi Arabia is attempting to curb OPEC output. Wellemeyer said that sharp declines in U.S. oil production could push demand for OPEC oil above 20 mln barrels per day as early as 1989 and up to 24 mln barrels per day by 1993. Although the projected increases in demand for OPEC oil should strengthen world prices, Wellemeyer said he believed the organization would hold its official price below 20 dlrs a barrel for some time to prevent residual fuel users from switching to natural gas supplies. The interfuel swing market accounts for about eight mln barrels a day, or 18 pct of the world demand for oil. KUWAIT SAID SEEKING FOREIGN PROTECTION FOR OIL Kuwait has asked at least four countries, including the United States, Soviet Union, Britain and China, for temporary use of their flags or tankers to protect Kuwaiti oil shipments in the troubled Persian Gulf, Reagan Administration officials said. The officials confirmed a New York Times report that Kuwait wants to transfer some of its oil tankers to U.S. or Soviet registration in hopes Iran would be reluctant to launch new \"Silkworm\" missiles at superpower flags. The United States has vowed to keep the gulf open to international oil traffic and has warned Tehran against using the Chinese-made missiles recently installed in Iran near the mouth of the gulf. \"They (the Kuwaitis) have also asked Britain, China and possibly some other European countries to lease tankers to carry their oil,\" one of the administration officials, who asked not to be identified, told Reuters. The United States is considering the request to temporarily transfer Kuwaiti ships to American registration, but such a move could create insurance and other problems, the officials said. U.S. defense officials told Reuters yesterday that Kuwait had decided for at least the time being not to accept a U.S. offer to use American warships to escort its tankers in the gulf, where both Iran and Iraq have been attacking shipping. KUWAIT ASKS TO USE FOREIGN FLAG TANKERS, U.S SAYS Kuwait has asked at least four countries, including the United States, Soviet Union, Britain and China, for temporary use of their flags or tankers to protect Kuwaiti oil shipments in the troubled Persian Gulf, Reagan Administration officials said.

The United States is considering the request to temporarily transfer Kuwaiti ships to American registration, but such a move could create insurance and other problems, the officials said. U.S. defense officials told Reuters yesterday that Kuwait had decided for at least the time being not to accept a U.S. offer to use American warships to escort its tankers in the gulf, where both Iran and Iraq have been attacking shipping. COOPERATIVE ENERGY TESTS OIL AT TWO WELLS &lt;Cooperative Energy Development Corp> said two exploratory oil wells in the Zama area of Alberta tested 1,020 and 950 barrels a day, and will increase the company\\'s daily oil production by 30 pct. The company did not immediately elaborate on total production figures. The wells, flowing oil from the Keg River formation, will be constrained to combined production of about 450 barrels a day to optimize reserve recovery, the company said. Permanent production facilities are being installed and the wells will produce to pipeline by mid-April. OPEC MAY HAVE TO MEET TO FIRM PRICES - ANALYSTS OPEC may be forced to meet before a scheduled June session to readdress its production cutting agreement if the organization wants to halt the current slide in oil prices, oil industry analysts said. \"The movement to higher oil prices was never to be as easy as OPEC thought. They may need an emergency meeting to sort out the problems,\" said Daniel Yergin, director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, CERA. Analysts and oil industry sources said the problem OPEC faces is excess oil supply in world oil markets. \"OPEC\\'s problem is not a price problem but a production issue and must be addressed in that way,\" said Paul Mlotok, oil analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc. He said the market\\'s earlier optimism about OPEC and its ability to keep production under control have given way to a pessimistic outlook that the organization must address soon if it wishes to regain the initiative in oil prices. But some other analysts were uncertain that even an emergency meeting would address the problem of OPEC production above the 15.8 mln bpd quota set last December. \"OPEC has to learn that in a buyers market you cannot have deemed quotas, fixed prices and set differentials,\" said the regional manager for one of the major oil companies who spoke on condition that he not be named. \"The market is now trying to teach them that lesson again,\" he added. David T. Mizrahi, editor of Mideast reports, expects OPEC to meet before June, although not immediately. However, he is not optimistic that OPEC can address its principal problems. \"They will not meet now as they try to take advantage of the winter demand to sell their oil, but in late March and April when demand slackens,\" Mizrahi said. But Mizrahi said that OPEC is unlikely to do anything more than reiterate its agreement to keep output at 15.8 mln bpd.\" Analysts said that the next two months will be critical for OPEC\\'s ability to hold together prices and output. \"OPEC must hold to its pact for the next six to eight weeks since buyers will come back into the market then,\" said Dillard Spriggs of Petroleum Analysis Ltd in New York. But Bijan Moussavar-Rahmani of Harvard University\\'s Energy and Environment Policy Center said that the demand for OPEC oil has been rising through the first quarter and this may have prompted excesses in its production. \"Demand for their (OPEC) oil is clearly above 15.8 mln bpd and is probably closer to 17 mln bpd or higher now so what we are seeing characterized as cheating is OPEC meeting this demand through current production,\" he told Reuters in a telephone interview. SUPPLIES, MIDEAST TENSION FUEL GAINS IN OIL Petroleum futures rallied today in a market that was expecting declines in domestic supplies and became further unsettled by escalated Mideast fighting. Crude oil, gasoline and heating oil all posted gains on the New York Mercantile Exchange, with crude oil prices matching life-of-contract highs. Crude for delivery in May closed 17 cents higher at 18.84 dlrs a barrel. \"Crude futures could jump above 19 dlrs a barrel but will not remain there long if products are not strong,\" Robert Murphy, account executive at E.F. Hutton, said. Traders said prices were supported by anticipation that the American Petroleum Institute would report a decline in domestic inventories of petroleum products in a weekly report. Traders said prices also were supported by an escalation in the Iran-Iraq war, with the Iranians reportedly launching a new offensive against Iraqi positions, and Iraq attacking offshore oil fields and an oil export depot. Buying by speculators continued to prompt gains in gold and silver futures on the Commodity Exchange in New York. Gold prices retreated at midday, but rallied before the close with support from the silver market, which was approaching two-year highs, traders said. Soybean futures posted strong gains on the Chicago Board of Trade, while corn and wheat were mostly higher. Traders said cash sales have been slow in the country, and the soybean harvest in Brazil has been delayed by rain, which is limiting supplies. In addition, the Agriculture Department last week projected a substantial drop in soybean acreage this year.     Monday\\'s report that the USDA inspected 46 mln bushels of corn for export last week was unexpectedly high and, coupled with a lack of farm sales, provided support for the corn market, traders said. Live hogs and frozen pork bellies rallied on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, while cattle ended lower. Live hogs pushed ahead on a lack of supplies because many farmers are turning their attention to spring planting rather than marketing livestock, traders said, noting that cash sales have been lighter than expected this week. The lack of marketing also has supported pork bellies, but prices drifted lower for moderate losses in nearby months as speculators sold contracts to take profits, traders said. Cattle prices closed lower but continued to show strength related to tight supplies. Prices pushed ahead to new contract highs, extending gains past three-year peaks set Monday, as tight supplies forced meat packers to bid aggressively for available animals. However, some traders sold contracts to take profits after the extended rally, which has seen the April delivery contract soar to 69.90 cents a pound from 56 cents a pound at the start of the year. New York coffee futures closed higher on trade talk Brazil would not be an aggressive seller near term, analysts said.

In its weekly statistical bulletin, the oil industry trade group said gasoline stocks rose 2.29 mln barrels to 247.91 mln barrels from a revised 245.62 mln, and crude oil stocks were up 8.52 mln barrels to 337.73 mln from a revised 329.21 mln. It said residual fuel stocks rose 28,000 barrels to 38.25 mln from a revised 37.98 mln barrels. API said refinery runs in the week rose to 12.54 mln barrels per day from 12.21 mln and refinery use of operating capacity was 80.4 pct, up from 78.3 pct. Crude oil imports in the week fell to 3.40 mln bpd from a revised 3.60 mln, API added. SUN RAISES CRUDE OIL POSTINGS ONE DLR ACROSS BOARD. WTI NOW 17.00 DLRS/BBL SUN RAISES CRUDE OIL POSTINGS ONE DLR ACROSS BOARD. WTI NOW 17.00 DLRS/BBL JANUARY CRUDE OIL MOVEMENTS FALL SEVEN MLN TONS Worldwide spot crude oil movements fell to 30.07 mln long dwt in February from 37.25 mln tons in January and 41.44 mln in December, London shipbroker Howard Houlder said. The decline mainly reflected a sharp drop in movements out of the Mideast Gulf, which totalled 7.4 mln tons last month against 11.65 mln in January. These included shipments to western options at 2.05 mln tons against 3.59 mln previously. Liftings from the Gulf to eastern options fell to 4.15 mln tons from 5.94 mln and those from the Gulf to other areas dropped to 1.2 mln tons from 2.13 mln, Howard Houlder said. U.K./Continent coastal movements declined sharply to 2.91 mln tons from 4.77 mln but those from the U.K./Continent to the U.S. rose to 1.99 mln from 1.69 mln. ENERGY/CALIFORNIA OIL PRODUCTION Drilling for oil in California is likely to continue at last year\\'s sharply reduced levels despite recent gains in crude oil prices, industry analysts said. Because much of the crude oil in California fields is thick, heavy and expensive to extract, oil prices would have to increase to near 1985\\'s levels before any significant recovery is seen in drilling, they said. \"Companies will probably only drill their best prospects,\" said John Curti, an analyst with Birr Wilson Securities Inc. Few new wells now are being drilled. Only 33 rigs, about one-quarter of the total available, were drilling for oil onshore in California last week, compared to about 70 last year, said Bill Bolster of Munger Oil Information Services, which tracks California drilling activity. \"It\\'s in the dregs right now,\" said Bolster of the state\\'s drilling activity. Current prices are not enough to justify increased drilling, said Ed Malmgreen of the California Independent Producers Association. While an Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries pact to curb production boosted oil prices early this year, prices eventually fell. Prices for California\\'s marker grade, Line 63 blend, have slumped about 20 pct in the last month to 14 dlrs from a high of about 17 dlrs. More than half of California\\'s oil comes from stripper wells, those producing less than 10 barrels a day, and that much of that oil costs between 18 and 25 dlrs a barrel to extract, Malmgreen said. \"It\\'s not unusual for a stripper well to cost 18 dlrs,\" Malmgreen said. Many stripper wells along the southern California coast produce eight times as much water as crude oil, and inland wells frequently require the use of steam injection to spur extraction of the thick, heavy oil, he said. The outlook for future production in California is clouded by a lack of exploratory drilling now, analysts said. In the heart of California\\'s oil patch, Kern County, which produces about two-thirds of the state\\'s oil, exploratory drilling has slowed to a crawl. Only 55 exploratory wells were drilled in Kern County in 1986, compared to 137 in 1985, according to David Mitchell of the state energy commission. So far this year only five exploratory wells have been drilled. \"I don\\'t think they\\'ll even get to what they did last year,\" Mitchell said. No pickup in exploratory drilling is likely for the rest of the decade, Mitchell said. Along with the fall in drilling has come a decrease in the number of producing wells and overall production. Between February and October of 1986, the number of producing oil wells in California fell 14 pct to 43,521 from more than 50,000, said Bill Guerard of the California Energy Commission. In line with that decrease, California\\'s crude oil output fell about 10 pct last year due to low oil prices and is expected to remain at that lower level, analysts said. Between February and October 1986, California\\'s crude oil production slipped from an all-time high of 1.185 mln barrels per day to 1.066 mln bpd, Guerard said. Total estimated crude oil production in California for 1986 was 408 mln bbls, compared with 424 mln bbls in 1985 and 405 mln bbl in 1983, according to the California Department of Conservation. \"Production in 1987 will probably hold around 1986 levels,\" Guerard said. STERLING IN TEXAS GAS AND OIL DISCOVERY &lt;Sterling Investment Group> said it successfully drilled and completed a significant development well 65 miles southwest of Houston, Texas. The well has a choke of 11/64 of an inch and is 10,097 feet deep. The well initially tested at a maximum daily flow rate of two mln cubic feet of gas and 304 barrels of condensate. Participants in the new well, along with Sterling, are Trafalgar House Ltd of the U.K. and &lt;Texstar NOrth America Inc.> IRANIAN OIL MINISTER DUE IN ALGERIA ON FRIDAY Iranian Oil Minister Gholamreza Aqazadeh is expected here on Friday for talks with his Algerian counterpart Belkacem Nabi, the official Algerian news agency APS said today. Aqazadeh, who will be accompanied by a large delegation, will have talks on bilateral relations in the field of energy and exchange views with Algerian officials on the current world energy situation, it said. U.K. OIL INDUSTRY SAID NOT PERMANENTLY DAMAGED The U.K. Offshore oil industry has suffered from last year\\'s collapse in oil prices but should not sustain any permament damage, Minister of State for Energy Alick Buchanan-Smith said. The drilling, diving and supply vessels sectors had been most affected, Buchanan Snith told the House of Commons energy committee. He noted, however, that oil companies were still spending six mln stg a day to maintain North Sea production. He added that a report by the manpower services committee which said 14,000 jobs were lost in the industry in 1986 should be seen in the context of a total workforce of 300,000. Prices of North Sea Brent-grade crude dipped to a low of 8.50 dlrs a barrel last July from a peak of over 30 dlrs the previous November. They recovered to around 18 dlrs a barrel after last December\\'s OPEC meeting and Brent traded today around 17.15 dlrs. Buchanan-Smith said the U.K. Has no intention of adopting OPEC style quotas, noting that Britian is an oil-consuming as well as an oil-producing nation. RESOURCE EXPLORATION &lt;REXI> IN DRILLING PACT Resource Exploration Inc said it has agreed to let &lt;Langasco Energy Corp> drill 50 oil and natural gas wells on its Clinton Sandstone formation within its Tuscarawas and Harrison County, Ohio area of operation. Resource said it would receive a cash payment and an overriding royalty interest on oil and gas production from wells drilled on the property. Resource said gas produced from the property will be transported through its existing pipeline. Also, Resource said it will provide service work to complete the wells and it will operate the wells after they are completed. TEXAS OIL REGULATOR CALLS FOR STATE TAX BREAKS Texas Railroad Commissioner James Nugent, saying that the ailing oilpatch cannot wait for Congress to act, today urged Texas state lawmakers to adopt incentives to find new oil reserves and to exempt severance taxes on oil produced from stripper wells. Nugent said in a speech to the Texas house of representatives that the state must take the initiative in molding U.S. energy policy and finding new ways to assist troubled oil producers. His proposal to revitalize Texas\\' oil industry would exempt stripper wells that produce 10 barrels of oil or less each day from the state\\'s 4.6 pct severance tax. He said that the majority of Texas\\' oil wells fall within the stripper well category and a price swing of two to three dlrs a barrel can be crucial in determining if the well remains in production. Nugent also called for state lawmakers to exempt new wildcat wells from the state severance tax for up to five years as a financial incentive to explore for new oil reserves. Secondary and tertiary oil production, expensive methods of production that inject water or gas into the ground to recover oil, should also be exempted from the severance tax, Nugent said. His plan would exempt existing secondary and tertiary wells that produce at a rate of less than three barrels a day for three years, or until the price of oil reaches $25 a barrel. \"We\\'ve been sitting back and waiting on two federal administrations to develop a coherent energy policy for the nation to follow. I say we have waited long enough,\" Nugent said. \"In other words, let\\'s tell Washington to either lead, follow, or get out of the way.\" Nugent said that the financial losses to the state treasury by exempting marginal oil production from state severance taxes would be more than made up by stimulating new business for the oil supply and service industry.

In its weekly petroleum status report, the Department of Energy agency said gasoline stocks were off 100,000 barrels in the week to 251.5 mln barrels and refinery crude oil stocks were up 3.2 mln barrels to 333.0 mln. The EIA said residual fuel stocks fell 2.2 mln barrels to 37.9 mln barrels and crude oil stocks in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) were up 700,000 barrels to 516.5 mln. The total of all crude, refined product and SPR stocks were unchanged at 1,575.1 mln barrels, it said. SOUTHLAND &lt;SLC> UNIT RAISES CRUDE PRICES Southland Corp\\'s Citgo Petrleum Corp said it raised the contract price it will pay for all grades of crude oil by one dlr a barrel, effective today. The increase brings Citgo\\'s posted price for West Texas Intermediate to 17.00 dlrs a bbl. West Texas Sour is also now priced at 17.00 dlrs/bbl, and Light Louisiana South is posted at 17.35 dlrs/bbl. On February 25 Citgo lowered its crude postings 50 cts to 1.50 dlrs per bbl, and cut WTI one dlr to 16.00. RECENT U.S. OIL DEMAND UP 2.1 PCT FROM YEAR AGO U.S. oil demand as measured by products supplied rose 2.1 pct in the four weeks ended February 27 to 16.39 mln barrels per day (bpd) from 16.05 mln in the same period a year ago, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) said. In its weekly petroleum status report, the Energy Department agency said distillate demand was down 2.1 pct in the period to 3.37 mln bpd from 3.44 mln a year earlier. Gasoline demand averaged 6.60 mln bpd, up 2.4 pct from 6.44 mln last year, while residual fuel demand was 1.47 mln bpd, up 1.9 pct from 1.44 mln, the EIA said. Domestic crude oil production was estimated at 8.38 mln bpd, down 8.7 pct from 9.18 mln a year ago, and gross daily crude imports (excluding those for the SPR) averaged 4.11 mln bpd, up 36.9 pct from three mln, the EIA said. Refinery crude runs in the four weeks were 12.21 mln bpd, up 2.2 pct from 12 mln a year earlier, it said. Year-to-date figures will not become available until March 26 when EIA\\'s Petroleum Supply Monthly data for January 1987 becomes available, the agency said. TEXACO CANADA CUTS CRUDE PRICES 64 CANADIAN CTS/BBL, PAR GRADE TO 22.26 CANADIAN DLRS TEXACO CANADA CUTS CRUDE PRICES 64 CANADIAN CTS/BBL, PAR GRADE TO 22.26 CANADIAN DLRS CREDITORS SEEK SWIFT RESCUE PACKAGE FOR JAPAN LINE A group of creditor banks hopes to work out a rescue package for Japan Line Ltd &lt;JLIT.T>, one of the world\\'s largest tanker operators, by the end of Japan\\'s business year on March 31, a spokesman for the Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd &lt;IBJT.T> (IBJ) said. Japan Line\\'s cumulative debt was 68.98 billion yen at the end of September, which exceeded shareholders\\' equities and reserves totalling 63.40 billion. In December, Japan Line asked banks to shelve repayment of about 124 billion yen in outstanding loans and about 153 billion in loans to its subsidiaries. Japan Line said then that the yen\\'s steep rise and the world shipping recession had hit the company hard. The Japanese daily Asahi Shimbun said today that IBJ and three other banks plan to abandon a total of 16 billion yen in loans to Japan Line and a group of creditor banks plans to buy seven billion yen of new Japan Line shares. The spokesman for IBJ, Japan Line\\'s largest creditor, said the package may write off part of the outstanding loans and will be worked out before long. Commenting on the article, he said the details of the package have not yet been settled. OPEC STICKING FIRM ON OFFICIAL PRICES - SUBROTO OPEC countries are all sticking firmly to official crude oil prices but the volatility of spot prices is likely to continue into the third quarter, Indonesian Minister of Mines and Energy Subroto told Reuters. Subroto, attending a Pacific Energy Cooperation conference, blamed recent rapid spot price changes on unbalanced supply and demand. \"If we stick to the production limitation, the third quarter will be in better balance.\" He said the market is in a period of transition while the impact of OPEC\\'s December agreement to cut output and fix prices at an average 18 dlrs a barrel is worked through. Asked whether OPEC members of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) had any concrete proposals to help Qatar sell its crude oil in the face of strong resistance to its official prices, Subroto said: \"Apparently they have taken care of that.\" \"They (the GCC) meet very often among themselves. I think they\\'ll help each other,\" he said. Subroto said that as he was not a member of OPEC\\'s Price Differentials Committee he did not know why the meeting had been postponed from its scheduled April 2 date. \"Maybe they find it is better not to have the meeting because ... Everyone is sticking to official prices,\" he said. TEXACO CANADA &lt;TXC> LOWERS CRUDE POSTINGS Texaco Canada said it lowered the contract price it will pay for crude oil 64 Canadian cts a barrel, effective today. The decrease brings the company\\'s posted price for the benchmark grade, Edmonton/Swann Hills Light Sweet, to 22.26 Canadian dlrs a bbl. Texaco Canada last changed its crude oil postings on Feb 19. MARATHON PETROLEUM REDUCES CRUDE POSTINGS Marathon Petroleum Co said it reduced the contract price it will pay for all grades of crude oil one dlr a barrel, effective today. The decrease brings Marathon\\'s posted price for both West Texas Intermediate and West Texas Sour to 16.50 dlrs a bbl. The South Louisiana Sweet grade of crude was reduced to 16.85 dlrs a bbl. The company last changed its crude postings on Jan 12. PAPUA NEW GUINEA PLANS RESOURCES INVESTMENT AGENCY The Papua New Guinea Government will establish a public corporation to invest in resources projects, Minerals and Energy Minister John Kaputin said. \"We intend to provide a means through which less privileged individuals can become part owners and beneficiaries from the development of mining and petroleum projects,\" he told Parliament. Existing policy allowing the state up to 30 pct equity in major mining projects and 22.5 pct in oil and gas projects would be maintained, he said. The planned agency could take over the state\\'s equity in current developments. Kaputin said Papua New Guinea was experiencing a boom with exploration companies spending about 60 mln kina annually on about 150 mining and 23 petroleum projects. \"The Government is determined to ensure that Papua New Guinean ownership in minerals and petroleum projects increases in an orderly way,\" he said. Kaputin did not say when the corporation would be established or exactly what form it would take, but said the government would study whether it should be directly involved in exploration or development. ICE UNCHANGED AT SOVIET OIL PORT OF VENTSPILS Ice conditions are unchanged at the Soviet Baltic oil port of Ventspils, with continuous and compacted drift ice 15 to 30 cms thick, the latest report of the Finnish Board of Navigation said. Icebreaker assistance to reach Ventspils harbour is needed for normal steel vessels without special reinforcement against ice, the report said. It gave no details of ice conditions at the other major Soviet Baltic export harbour of Klaipeda. EARLY MARCH OPEC OUTPUT SEEN WELL BELOW CEILING OPEC crude oil output in the first few days of March was running at about 14.7 mln bpd, down from a 16 mln bpd average for February and well below the 15.8 mln bpd ceiling the group adopted in December, a Reuter survey shows. The figures were polled by Reuters correspondents from oil traders, industry executives and analysts in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Latin America and Asia. They back recent statements by OPEC ministers that the group is producing within its ceiling to support the return to a fixed price system, which came into effect last month. OPEC output for the whole of February was about 200,000 bpd above the ceiling, largely because of overproduction by the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait, the figures show. The UAE, together with the much smaller producer Ecuador, was also producing above quota in the first days of March, the survey reveals. But such overproduction was compensated for by a sharp fall in Saudi Arabian output, together with Iran\"s inability to export as much as its quota allows. Iraq rejected its OPEC quota of 1.466 mln bpd and produced 1.75 mln bpd in February and early March, the figures showed. Saudi output -- excluding movements into stocks -- fell to 3.1 mln bpd in early March from 3.5 mln bpd in February, against a 4.133 mln bpd quota. The Saudi figures include a 200,000 bpd share of Neutral Zone production. Kuwait, which has consistently denied quota violations, was estimated to be pumping 1.4 mln bpd in February and 1.15 in early March -- both figures including 200,000 bpd as its share of Neutral Zone output -- against its 948,000 bpd quota. Reports of customer resistance to fixed prices set by some OPEC states were reflected in output from Qatar and Nigeria, both substantially under quota in February and early March. Qatar\\'s February output was 230,000 bpd, and this fell to 180,000 bpd in early March compared with its 285,000 bpd quota. Industry sources say Japanese buyers are resisting Qatar\"s prices and Gulf Arab oil states have pledged to make up for any shortfall in sales which a fellow Gulf state suffers. Nigeria\\'s early March output was about one mln bpd, down from 1.14 mln bpd in February and its quota of 1.238 mln bpd. Industry sources say Nigeria\\'s customers believe its Bonny grades are overpriced compared with compatible Brent crudes from the U.K. North Sea.

Orbit said it has reserves of 2.4 mln barrels of oil and natural gas liquids and 67.2 billion cubic feet of natural gas. In addition, 75 pct owned &lt;Sienna Resources Ltd> has Canadian reserves of 173,000 barrels of oil and 1.6 bcf of natural gas with a current value of 2.2 mln dlrs, Orbit said. DIAMOND SHAMROCK &lt;DIA> RAISES CRUDE OIL POSTINGS Diamond Shamrock said it raised its posted prices for all grades of crude oil one dlr a barrel, effective yesterday. The one dlr increase brings West Texas Intermediate, WTI the U.S. benchmark crude, to 17.00 dlrs a bbl, the company said. Diamond Shamrock joined Sun Co, Coastal, Citgo and Murphy Oil in raising crude oil posted prices one dlr a barrel yesterday. ROYAL DUTCH/SHELL U.S. EARNINGS SHARPLY LOWER Royal Dutch/Shell Group &lt;RD.AS> earnings for 1986 from the U.S. Fell sharply because of difficult market conditions, lower crude and gas prices and also due to different accounting methods, Shell chairman Peter Holmes said. The Shell Oil dollar net income fell 47 pct in the year, while the additional effect of currency movements reduced the contribution to group net income by 57 pct to 472 mln stg. The group earlier reported a drop in net income for the year to 2.54 billion stg from 3.03 billion previously, with lower crude prices outweighing the effect of increased sales by volume. Although the figures were lower, they were nonetheless at the top end of market forecasts. Shell Transport and Trading Plc &lt;SC.L> shares, the U.K. Arm of the group, rose to 11.39 stg from a close last night of 11.06 stg. Analysts noted that a general collapse in exploration and production volumes was partially offset by earnings from chemicals rising to 462 mln stg from 205 mln in 1985. Also, a windfall tax credit and lower than expected currency losses had added about 100 mln stg onto fourth quarter results, which was the main reason for the figures exceeding forecasts, industry analyst Chris Rowland of Barclays de Zoete Wedd noted. However, he added there could well be a sharp fall in performance in the first quarter of 1987, due to the improbability that the group would be able to repeat the high refining and marketing margins of first quarter 1986. The impact of recovering oil prices would come through faster on the downstream side than on the upstream as such a high proportion of upstream activity centred on gas, which typically reacted to oil price changes with about a half-year lag, analysts said. Holmes said that in the upstream U.S. Sector the third quarter of 1986 had been the worst of all. Only two of the oil majors had managed to make a profit in the period, with Shell Oil being one of them. The decrease in U.S. Earnings had been accentuated by tax rates but the group had increased share to become volume market leader, Holmes added. Continued low crude oil prices would continue to subdue U.S. Exploration activity. \"Exploration is currently pretty flat. We are going to go on, but at 16-18 dlrs there will be no massive upturn,\" he said. A renewal of exploration in high cost areas of the North Sea and the U.S. Requires prices of around 25 dlrs a barrel. Ultimately this would lead to a rise in U.S. Imports. \"If you are not exploring you are not going to find anything,\" he noted. U.S. Oil production had dropped some half mln barrels a day (bbd) in 1986 and would continue to fall if the price stayed below 20 dlrs a barrel. This favored OPEC\\'s attempts to stabilise prices, as the lower the price the more likelihood there was of non-OPEC marginal production shutting down. \"OPEC has done pretty extraordinarily well...Everything is moving in (its) direction,\" he added. HOUSTON OIL &lt;HO> RESERVES STUDY COMPLETED Houston Oil Trust said that independent petroleum engineers completed an annual study that estimates the trust\\'s future net revenues from total proved reserves at 88 mln dlrs and its discounted present value of the reserves at 64 mln dlrs. Based on the estimate, the trust said there may be no money available for cash distributions to unitholders for the remainder of the year. It said the estimates reflect a decrease of about 44 pct in net reserve revenues and 39 pct in discounted present value compared with the study made in 1985. OPEC SAYS FEBRUARY OUTPUT UNDER CEILING OPEC output in February was \"well below\" the 15.8 mln bpd ceiling it set in December and all countries are strictly adhering to their quotas, the OPEC news agency Opecna quoted an OPEC secretariat official as saying. The official was quoted as saying that lower output was the result \"of member countries\\' firm determination to defend the organisation\\'s official price of 18 dlrs per barrel, and to refrain from selling any quantity below that price.\" The unnamed official was further quoted as saying that no OPEC meeting was foreseen before the next biannual OPEC session planned to start on June 25. The official gave no figure for February output. The statement said only that \"the reduction in total supplies, namely actual exports of crude oil and products, plus local deliveries in member countries, is even more pronounced as those supplies fell very noticeably during that month.\" \"No matter what the pressure on member countries by lifters to align the official selling price to the ongoing market price, member countries are, without exception, strictly adhering to the official selling price in spite of the financial hardship this may entail,\" the statement said. \"The very recent improvement in the price structure is an indicator of such determination by the organization to stick to the official selling price,\" the statement said. Free spot market prices rose from around 14.50 dlrs a barrel in early December last year to near OPEC\\'s official levels towards the end of the year, after the OPEC pact. There has been oil industry speculation that OPEC might have to hold an extraordinrary meeting prior to its scheduled June session to discuss reports of overproduction by some states and strains on the differential matrix, which prices each OPEC crude according to its quality and distance from main markets. The official said in the statement that no such emergency session was scheduled \"because of member countries\\' firm determination to defend the price (system)\" agreed in December. Opec\"s differential committee was to have met in Vienna starting April 2 but this session has been postponed, with no new date set, according to an official of the United Arab Emirates, which chairs the seven-state body. Other members are Algeria, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Libya, Nigeria and Qatar. MARATHON RAISES CRUDE POSTED PRICES 50 CTS A BBL, EFFECTIVE TODAY, WTI AT 17 DLRS/BBL. MARATHON RAISES CRUDE POSTED PRICES 50 CTS A BBL, EFFECTIVE TODAY, WTI AT 17 DLRS/BBL. REPORT DUE ON OIL IMPORTS AND NATIONAL SECURITY A presidential commission that has been studying oil imports, including their effect on national security, is to to make its report soon, the White House said. Spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the panel, set up last October to examine U.S. oil import needs, would make its report soon, probably within the next few weeks. He said National Security Adviser Frank Carlucci \"will wait until that report is in and then see if there is any special action needed to be taken in the national security area to implement it.\" BAD WEATHER CLOSES ALEXANDRIA PORT, OIL TERMINAL Strong winds and high seas today closed Alexandria, Egypt\\'s biggest port, and an oil pipeline terminal nearby, officials said. Facilities of the Suez-Mediterranean Arab Petroleum Pipelines Company at Sidi Kreir, 32 km southeast of Alexandria, were closed this morning after one tanker loaded and sailed. Officials said that five other tankers were waiting outside the terminal for conditions to improve. EGYPTIAN 1986 CRUDE OIL OUTPUT DOWN ON 1985 Non-Opec Egypt produced 40.3 mln tonnes (about 295 mln barrels) of crude in 1986 against 44.3 mln tonnes (about 323 mln barrels) in 1985, according to official figures released today by the Egyptian General Petroleum Corp. (EGPC). Officials say Egypt can produce up to one mln bpd per day, but production was cut when world prices plunged last year. In an attempt to help OPEC stabilize the world market, Egypt cut its 1987 production target of 940,000 bpd to its current output of 870,000 bpd. Egypt, which exports a third of its output, currently sells its top Suez and Ras Bahar blends for 17.25 dlrs a barrel. KUWAIT SAYS NO PLANS FOR EMERGENCY OPEC TALKS Kuwait\"s Oil Minister, in remarks published today, said there were no plans for an emergency OPEC meeting to review oil policies after recent weakness in world oil prices. Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah was quoted by the local daily al-Qabas as saying: \"None of the OPEC members has asked for such a meeting.\" He denied Kuwait was pumping above its quota of 948,000 barrels of crude daily (bpd) set under self-imposed production limits of the 13-nation organisation. Traders and analysts in international oil markets estimate OPEC is producing up to one mln bpd above a ceiling of 15.8 mln bpd agreed in Geneva last December. They named Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, along with the much smaller producer Ecuador, among those producing above quota. Kuwait, they said, was pumping 1.2 mln bpd. \"This rumour is baseless. It is based on reports which said Kuwait has the ability to exceed its share. They suppose that because Kuwait has the ability, it will do so,\" the minister said. Sheikh Ali has said before that Kuwait had the ability to produce up to 4.0 mln bpd. \"If we can sell more than our quota at official prices, while some countries are suffering difficulties marketing their share, it means we in Kuwait are unusually clever,\" he said. He was referring apparently to the Gulf state of qatar, which industry sources said was selling less than 180,000 bpd of its 285,000 bpd quota, because buyers were resisting official prices restored by OPEC last month pegged to a marker of 18 dlrs per barrel. Prices in New York last week dropped to their lowest levels this year and almost three dollars below a three-month high of 19 dollars a barrel. Sheikh Ali also delivered \"a challenge to any international oil company that declared Kuwait sold below official prices.\" Because it was charging its official price, of 16.67 dlrs a barrel, it had lost custom, he said but did not elaborate. However, Kuwait had guaranteed markets for its oil because of its local and international refining facilities and its own distribution network abroad, he added. He reaffirmed that the planned meeting March 7 of OPEC\"s differentials committee has been postponed until the start of April at the request of certain of the body\"s members. Ecuador\"s deputy energy minister Fernando Santos Alvite said last Wednesday his debt-burdened country wanted OPEC to assign a lower official price for its crude, and was to seek this at talks this month of opec\"s pricing committee. Referring to pressure by oil companies on OPEC members, in apparent reference to difficulties faced by Qatar, he said: \"We expected such pressure. It will continue through March and April.\" But he expected the situation would later improve. INDONESIA SEEN AT CROSSROADS OVER ECONOMIC CHANGE Indonesia appears to be nearing a political crossroads over measures to deregulate its protected economy, the U.S. Embassy says in a new report. To counter falling oil revenues, the government has launched a series of measures over the past nine months to boost exports outside the oil sector and attract new investment. Indonesia, the only Asian member of OPEC and a leading primary commodity producer, has been severely hit by last year\"s fall in world oil prices, which forced it to devalue its currency by 31 pct in September. But the U.S. Embassy report says President Suharto\"s government appears to be divided over what direction to lead the economy. \"(It) appears to be nearing a crossroads with regard to deregulation, both as it pertains to investments and imports,\" the report says. It primarily assesses Indonesia\"s agricultural sector, but also reviews the country\"s general economic performance. It says that while many government officials and advisers are recommending further relaxation, \"there are equally strong pressures being exerted to halt all such moves.\" \"This group strongly favours an import substitution economy,\" the report says. Indonesia\"s economic changes have been welcomed by the World Bank and international bankers as steps in the right direction, though they say crucial areas of the economy like plastics and steel remain highly protected, and virtual monopolies. Three sets of measures have been announced since last May, which broadened areas for foreign investment, reduced trade restrictions and liberalised imports. The report says Indonesia\"s economic growth in calendar 1986 was probably about zero, and the economy may even have contracted a bit. \"This is the lowest rate of growth since the mid-1960s,\" the report notes. Indonesia, the largest country in South-East Asia with a population of 168 million, is facing general elections in April. But the report hold out little hope for swift improvement in the economic outlook. \"For 1987 early indications point to a slightly positive growth rate not exceeding one pct. Economic activity continues to suffer due to the sharp fall in export earnings from the petroleum industry.\" \"Growth in the non-oil sector is low because of weak domestic demand coupled with excessive plant capacity, real declines in construction and trade, and a reduced level of growth in agriculture,\" the report states. Bankers say continuation of present economic reforms is crucial for the government to get the international lending its needs. A new World Bank loan of 300 mln dlrs last month in balance of payments support was given partly to help the government maintain the momentum of reform, the Bank said. OPEC PRESIDENT SAYS OUTPUT WELL BELOW CEILING Opec Conference President Rilwanu Lukman said the group was producing well below the 15.8 mln bpd ceiling it set in December, partly because liftings had been delayed or postponed by customers unwilling to pay fixed Opec prices. Lukman, during a brief visit to London on his way home from Jamaica, told Reuters in a telephone interview that in February, Opec had underproduced partly because members were strictly abiding by production quotas and partly because they were resisting the temptation to sell at discounts to official prices of around 18 dlrs a barrel. \"We are determined to stand firm by the (December) accord,\" he said. \"I have spoken to every other Opec minister and they are committed to making the accord work,\" he said. Lukman gave no specific figures for February output. He said the Opec secretariat in Vienna was finalizing these figures. Told of a Reuters survey published today which estimated that Opec output so far this week was below 15 mln bpd, he said; \"That could well be correct.\" Opec\"s news agency Opecna today issued a statement saying group output was \"well below\" its ceiling in February. But it gave no figures. But one source close to Opec indicated that February output may have been between 15.3 and 15.5 mln bpd. The Reuter survey estimated Opec February output at around 16 mln bpd. Opec agreed in December to cut output by 7.25 pct to 15.8 mln bpd and to return to fixed prices starting February 1. Lukman said Qatar, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia and Iran had all produced in February below their Opec quotas. Iraq, which said it would not honour its 1.466 mln bpd quota under the December pact, had produced less than had been anticipated, he said. Lukman said that some industry reports \"may be correct\" that in February, Nigeria propuced 75-100,000 bpd below its 1.238 mln bpd quota, Saudi Arabia 500,000 bpd less than its 4.133 mln allocation and Qatar 20 to 30 pct under its 285,000 bpd quota. He said that sweet crudes such as those produced by his country were coming under price pressure because they were currently officially priced above sweet North Sea grades and the United States\" West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude. However, he said Opec in December had anticipated that demand would be slack at this time of year for seasonal reasons and expected the market to firm in two to three weeks. \"We have to be patient for two or three weeks. The market is now firming on actual fundamentals,\" he said, adding that he expected it to go \"up and up\" even beyond official prices after early April. This is when, traditionally, there is more demand for gasoline-rich crudes such as Nigeria\"s. The Opec President said producers such as Kuwait, Venezuela and Indonesia were having less problems with output than producers like his own country because they exported oil products. Also, some of Venezuela\"s heavy grades were outside the Opec pricing system, he said. Lukman said that if refiner-buyers, now refusing to lift some Opec oil at official prices, instead used their own stocks and ran them down to \"dangerous levels,\" they would eventually have to buy Opec oil. \"When they realise it is not a free-for-all (in the market) they will realise they should buy now instead of paying more later on,\" he said. Lukman, asked about industry reports that Nigeria was being pressured by equity producers for better terms, said it was important to know that terms with them were negotiable, flexible and under constant review, not only when the market seemed weak. He said that so far, no meeting of the seven-nation ministerial differentials committee had been scheduled and that such a meeting, now twice-postponed, was not a high priority for Opec at the moment. \"At this time, we have to get our priorities right,\" he said. \"The most important thing now is ensuring that the accord is working, not dealing with a differential of cents between grades.\" But if any Opec member raised concerns or objections over the differential system, a meeting would be called, he said. SAUDI RIYAL DEPOSIT RATES REMAIN FIRM Saudi riyal interbank deposits were steady at yesterday\\'s higher levels in a quiet market. Traders said they were reluctant to take out new positions amidst uncertainty over whether OPEC will succeed in halting the current decline in oil prices. Oil industry sources said yesterday several Gulf Arab producers had had difficulty selling oil at official OPEC prices but Kuwait has said there are no plans for an emergency meeting of the 13-member organisation. A traditional Sunday lull in trading due to the European weekend also contributed to the lack of market activity. Spot-next and one-week rates were put at 6-1/4, 5-3/4 pct after quotes ranging between seven, six yesterday. One, three, and six-month deposits were quoted unchanged at 6-5/8, 3/8, 7-1/8, 6-7/8 and 7-3/8, 1/8 pct respectively. The spot riyal was quietly firmer at 3.7495/98 to the dollar after quotes of 3.7500/03 yesterday. CONFIDENCE IN OPEC FIRMS U.S. ENERGY FUTURES Renewed confidence in OPEC\\'s ability to limit production helped U.S. energy futures settle above yesterday\\'s closing prices, according to analysts. They also said the heating oil contract found additional support from a short-covering rally on the close. April crude closed 24 cts higher to 17.75 dlrs. April heating oil was 1.47 cts higher to 47.91 cts a gallon. \"Most traders expected follow through profit-taking from yesterday but the market found suport from bullish reports that OPEC is producing within its quota,\" said Simon Greenshields, a vice president with Morgan Stanley and Co Inc. News today, including OPEC President Rilwanu Lukman statement that OPEC February production did not exceed its official quota of 15.8 mln barrels per day, helped bouy prices, traders said. A Reuter survey found OPEC production in early March was 14.7 mln bpd. In addition to short-covering, heating oil found support from traders buying it against sales of gasoline and crude, as well as from expectations for continued drawdowns in stocks as refiners shut down for maintenance, traders said. Unleaded gasoline for April finished 0.55 cent higher to 51.24 cts a gallon. QATAR UNVEILS BUDGET FOR FISCAL 1987/88 The Gulf oil state of Qatar, recovering slightly from last year\\'s decline in world oil prices, announced its first budget since early 1985 and projected a deficit of 5.472 billion riyals. The deficit compared with a shortfall of 7.3 billion riyals in the last published budget for 1985/86. In a statement outlining the budget for the fiscal year 1987/88 beginning today, Finance and Petroleum Minister Sheikh Abdul-Aziz bin Khalifa al-Thani said the government expected to spend 12.217 billion riyals in the period. Projected expenditure in the 1985/86 budget had been 15.6 billion riyals. Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said government revenue would be about 6.745 billion riyals, down by about 30 pct on the 1985/86 projected revenue of 9.7 billion. The government failed to publish a 1986/87 budget due to uncertainty surrounding oil revenues. Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said that during that year the government decided to limit recurrent expenditure each month to one-twelfth of the previous fiscal year\\'s allocations minus 15 pct. He urged heads of government departments and public institutions to help the government rationalise expenditure. He did not say how the 1987/88 budget shortfall would be covered. Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said plans to limit expenditure in 1986/87 had been taken in order to relieve the burden placed on the country\\'s foreign reserves. He added in 1987/88 some 2.766 billion riyals had been allocated for major projects including housing and public buildings, social services, health, education, transport and communications, electricity and water, industry and agriculture. No figure was revealed for expenditure on defence and security. There was also no projection for oil revenue. Qatar, an OPEC member, has an output ceiling of 285,000 barrels per day. Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said: \"Our expectations of positive signs regarding (oil) price trends, foremost among them OPEC\\'s determination to shoulder its responsibilites and protect its wealth, have helped us make reasonable estimates for the coming year\\'s revenue on the basis of our assigned quota.\" SAUDI ARABIA REITERATES COMMITMENT TO OPEC PACT Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Hisham Nazer reiterated the kingdom\\'s commitment to last December\\'s OPEC accord to boost world oil prices and stabilise the market, the official Saudi Press Agency SPA said. Asked by the agency about the recent fall in free market oil prices, Nazer said Saudi Arabia \"is fully adhering by the ... Accord and it will never sell its oil at prices below the pronounced prices under any circumstance.\" Nazer, quoted by SPA, said recent pressure on free market prices \"may be because of the end of the (northern hemisphere) winter season and the glut in the market.\" Saudi Arabia was a main architect of the December accord, under which OPEC agreed to lower its total output ceiling by 7.25 pct to 15.8 mln barrels per day (bpd) and return to fixed prices of around 18 dlrs a barrel. The agreement followed a year of turmoil on oil markets, which saw prices slump briefly to under 10 dlrs a barrel in mid-1986 from about 30 dlrs in late 1985. Free market prices are currently just over 16 dlrs. Nazer was quoted by the SPA as saying Saudi Arabia\\'s adherence to the accord was shown clearly in the oil market. He said contacts among members of OPEC showed they all wanted to stick to the accord. In Jamaica, OPEC President Rilwanu Lukman, who is also Nigerian Oil Minister, said the group planned to stick with the pricing agreement. \"We are aware of the negative forces trying to manipulate the operations of the market, but we are satisfied that the fundamentals exist for stable market conditions,\" he said. Kuwait\\'s Oil Minister, Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah, said in remarks published in the emirate\\'s daily Al-Qabas there were no plans for an emergency OPEC meeting to review prices. Traders and analysts in international oil markets estimate OPEC is producing up to one mln bpd above the 15.8 mln ceiling. They named Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, along with the much smaller producer Ecuador, among those producing above quota. Sheikh Ali denied that Kuwait was over-producing. FAVORED TRADE STATUS FOR MOSCOW STILL OPPOSED The Reagan administration wants to encourage expanded trade with the Soviet Union but does not believe Moscow yet warrants most-favored-nation treatment, Deputy Secretary of State John Whitehead said. \"It seems to me that more trade between us is better than less trade,\" he told a forum on U.S.-Soviet trade relations. To that end, the administration in January allowed foreign policy controls on the export of oil and gas equipment to the Soviet Union to lapse, he said. Also, Washington and its allies are reviewing remaining export controls in hopes of simplifying the list of prohibited items and speeding up the licensing process, he said. Whitehead said, however, the prefential treatment that comes with most-favored-nation status is out for the moment. U.S. law prohibits most-favored-nation status for countries that restrict emigration and other rights. \"What we have seen so far (in improved rights under Soviet Leader Mikhail Gorbachev) are promising trends,\" he said. But, he added: \"We don\\'t know if they will continue, we don\\'t know how significant they will be.\" SOUTH AFRICAN FIRM TO CONTINUE TESTS South Africa\\'s state-owned energy firm Soekor said it would continue tests after striking oil some 120 kms (75 miles) south-southwest of Mossel Bay. During production tests, about 5,000 barrels of oil and five mln cubic feet of gas per day were produced, it said. \"This oil discovery will be followed-up as soon as possible by further seismic surveys and drilling. Should further drilling and tests in the area yield positive results oil production from a floating platform could be considered.\" Director General of Mineral and Energy Affairs Louw Alberts announced the strike earlier but said it was uneconomic. GREECE REPEATS IT CAN DECIDE ON AEGEAN DRILLING Greece, replying to a warning from Turkey that it will stop Athens from seeking oil in the Aegean Sea, repeated today that it has an exclusive right to decide where or when to drill in the area. A government spokesman said in a statement that if Ankara believed Greece was contravening international law, it could bring the issue before the courts. The spokesman was responding to a statement by Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman Yalim Eralp that Ankara would take action to stop Greece\\'s oil activities beyond its territorial waters as they were a violation of the 1976 Berne accord. IEA SAYS OPEC FEBRUARY CRUDE OUTPUT 16.1 MLN BPD OPEC produced an average 16.1 mln barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil in February, down from 16.5 mln the previous month and an overall 17.3 mln bpd in fourth quarter 1986, the International Energy Agency said. A few OPEC countries last month exceeded the production quotas set at their last conference in December, but liftings were reduced from several countries, it said in its latest monthly oil market report. These cutbacks were due in part to buyer resistance to fixed prices, introduced from February 1, particularly for fixed volumes over an extended period. It gave this breakdown for OPEC crude output, in mln bpd FOURTH QTR 1986  JANUARY 1987  FEBRUARY 1987 SAUDI ARABIA    4.9              3.7           3.8 IRAN            1.6              2.2           1.9 IRAQ            1.6              1.6           1.7 UAE             1.3              1.2           1.2 KUWAIT          1.0              1.0           1.0 NEUTRAL ZONE    0.5              0.4           0.4 QATAR           0.3              0.3           0.2 NIGERIA         1.3              1.2           1.2 LIBYA           1.0              1.0           1.0 FOURTH QTR 1986  JANUARY 1987  FEBRUARY 1987 ALGERIA         0.6              0.6           0.6 GABON           0.1              0.2           0.2 VENEZUELA       1.6              1.6           1.6 ECUADOR         0.2              0.2           0.2 INDONESIA       1.3              1.2           1.2 TOTAL           17.3             16.5          16.1 The IEA said while Saudi production stayed below its quota of 4.133 mln bpd, actual sales might exceed output due to Norbec stock disposals. Contracts for Saudi crude have been signed, but it is understood they have much leeway in required liftings. The report said the reduction in Iraqi air attacks on Iranian export facilities allowed Iran\\'s output to reach 2.2 mln bpd in January, but buyer resistance to fixed prices apparently cut February production. It said Iraqi exports are about 1.0 mln bpd through the Turkish pipeline, 0.1-0.2 mln by truck through Jordan and 0.2-0.3 mln via the Saudi pipeline to Yanbu. Internal consumption is some 0.3 mln bpd. The IEA estimated total non-communist world oil supply in February at 45.0 mln bpd, down from 45.4 mln in January and 47.0 mln in the fourth quarter. The February world supply figure is made up of 16.1 mln bpd OPEC crude production, 1.4 mln bpd OPEC natural gas liquids (ngls), 16.6 mln bpd OECD crude and ngls, 8.3 mln bpd other developing countries\\' crude and ngls, net trade of 1.1 mln bpd with centrally planned economies, 0.5 mln bpd of non-conventional crudes (such as tar sands and oil from coal) and 1.0 mln bpd from processiing gains. Within the OECD, preliminary Norwegian data show record 1.06 mln bpd output in January, with lower production expected in February in accordance with government curtailments of approximately 80,000 bpd, announced in support of OPEC. PEMEX LOWERS FEBRUARY FAR EAST CRUDE OIL PRICES The Mexican state oil company Petroleos Mexicanos (PEMEX) said its Far East customers would be charged 17.25 dlrs per barrel for Isthmus crude in February and 14.45 dlrs for the heavier Maya. Pemex said this was 32 cts less than January Isthmus and 15 cts less than January Maya. Far East customers, primarily Japan which buys an average 180,000 barrels per day of which 150,000 is Isthmus, pay retroactively while European and U.S. clients are charged per delivery. PERMIAN &lt;PBT> RAISES CRUDE PRICES Permian Corp said that effective march 5 it raised its posted prices for crude oil 50 cts a barrel. The raise brought its posted prices for West texas Intermediate up by 50 cts to 17.00 dlrs a barrel. West Texas Sour was also raised by 50 cts to 17.00 dlrs a barrel. A Permian spokesman said that the South Louisiana sweet posted prices was also raised 50 cts a barrel to 17.35 dlrs. ECUADOR SAYS SUSPENDS OIL EXPORTS DUE EARTHQUAKE Ecuador today suspended its crude oil exports indefinitely due to an earthquake last night that damaged pumping and crude transport installations, an Energy and Mines MInistry statement said. It said the state oil firm Corporacion Estatal Petrolera Ecuatoriana (CEPE) notified foreign customers that it was declaring force majeure on its crude exports due to the tremor. Ecuador\"s OPEC oil output quota is 210,000 barrels per day (bpd). A senior energy ministry official said that one pumping station at El Salado on Ecuador\\'s main pipeline was damaged. He also said an 180 metre section of the pipeline attached to the bridge over the Aguarico river collapsed. The pumping station was about 20 km from the Reventador volcano, near the epicentre of the quake, which Ecuadorean seismologists said registered six on the 12-point international Mercalli scale. The Aguarico bridge was also close to the volcano, he said. The quake struck northern Ecaudor and southern Colombia, according to Ecuadorean officials. No injuries were reported. SAUDI FEBRUARY CRUDE OUTPUT PUT AT 3.5 MLN BPD Saudi crude oil output last month fell to an average of 3.5 mln barrels per day (bpd) from 3.8 mln bpd in January, Gulf oil sources said. They said exports from the Ras Tanurah and Ju\\'aymah terminals in the Gulf fell to an average 1.9 mln bpd last month from 2.2 mln in January because of lower liftings by some customers. But the drop was much smaller than expected after Gulf exports rallied in the fourth week of February to 2.5 mln bpd from 1.2 mln in the third week, the sources said. The production figures include neutral zone output but not sales from floating storage, which are generally considered part of a country\\'s output for Opec purposes. Saudi Arabia has an Opec quota of 4.133 mln bpd under a production restraint scheme approved by the 13-nation group last December to back new official oil prices averaging 18 dlrs a barrel. The sources said the two-fold jump in exports last week appeared to be the result of buyers rushing to lift February entitlements before the month-end. Last week\\'s high export levels appeared to show continued support for official Opec prices from Saudi Arabia\\'s main crude customers, the four ex-partners of Aramco, the sources said. The four -- Exxon Corp &lt;XON>, Mobil Corp &lt;MOB>, Texaco Inc &lt;TX> and Chevron Corp &lt;CHV> -- signed a long-term agreement last month to buy Saudi crude for 17.52 dlrs a barrel. However the sources said the real test of Saudi Arabia\\'s ability to sell crude at official prices in a weak market will come this month, when demand for petroleum products traditionally tapers off. Spot prices have fallen in recent weeks to more than one dlr below Opec levels. Saudi Arabian oil minister Hisham Nazer yesterday reiterated the kingdom\\'s commitment to the December OPEC accord and said it would never sell below official prices. The sources said total Saudi refinery throughput fell slightly in February to an average 1.1 mln bpd from 1.2 mln in January because of cuts at the Yanbu and Jubail export refineries. They put crude oil exports through Yanbu at 100,000 bpd last month, compared to zero in January, while throughput at Bahrain\\'s refinery and neutral zone production remained steady at around 200,000 bpd each. COLOMBIAN OIL EXPORTS NOT AFFECTED BY QUAKE Colombian oil installations were not damaged by an earthquake which shook Ecuador and southern Colombia last night and there are no plans to suspend exports, a spokesman for the state-run oil company Ecopetrol said. He said no damage was reported, unlike in Ecuador where indefinite force majeure was declared on crude exports. Colombia currently produces about 360,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude. Exports in january totalled 123,000 bpd. The quake, which in Colombia measured between 6.5 and seven on the 12-point international Mercalli scale, caused panic among residents but no injuries were reported. CRUDE OIL PRICES UP AS STOCKS, OUTPUT FALL U.S. crude oil prices rose above 18 dlrs a barrel this week and industry analysts said the price could rise another dollar as inventories fall. \"OPEC is keeping its production down, and in the cash market there is tight supply of crude with short transportation time to major refining centers,\" said Daniel McKinley, oil analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co. \"That could send prices 50 cts to a dollar higher,\" he added. The U.S. benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate rose to 18.15 dlrs a barrel today, a rise of 1.50 dlrs this week. The rally in oil prices this week came after prices fell in February more than two dlrs from its high of 18.25 dlrs a barrel. \"Oil traders were pulling prices down on the assumption that oil stocks were building and OPEC was producing well above its 15.8 mln bpd quota, but now both of those assumptions have come under question,\" McKinley said. Yesterday the International Energy Agency in its monthly report said that oil stocks in the OECD area, or in industrialized nations, were drawn down by 1.3 mln bpd during the first quarter of this year. IEA estimates that the draw in oil stocks during the first quarter of this year will come largely from oil companies whose inventory levels by April one will be an estimated 326 mln tonnes, or about 74 days consumption. Industry analysts also said the estimate of a 3.5 mln bpd draw in stocks made by Shell Chairman Peter Holmes yesterday fed speculation that other major companies were destocking. Traders said the destocking has come about as a result of a so-called buyers strike, which kept refiners from buying officially priced OPEC oil in an effort to get the organization to offer discounts to the official price. \"This struggle between the companies and OPEC is the ultimate game of chicken but it will be resolved relatively soon. I would imagine by about the middle of the month (March),\" the general trading manager of an international oil company told Reuters in a telephone interview. For its part OPEC has moved to win this game by cutting excess supplies from the market by a reduction of its own output, traders said. A Reuter survey estimates OPEC output to be 14.7 mln bpd this week. Also, an earthquake in Ecuador yesterday led it to suspend oil exports indefintiely and force majeure its shipments. \"This will reduce short-haul availabilities by about 250,000 bpd almost immediately and the longer the suspension continues, the larger the draw in stocks will be for companies expecting it to be there,\" McKinley said. International oil traders said that other short-haul crudes, such as North Sea Brent, were also scarce because Asian refiners bought the oil after absorbing a lot of the readily available Mideast crudes earlier this week. If this pattern continues then oil companies will bid up the price of oil as they purchase for their refineries, trading managers at several companies told Reuters. But there were skeptics who said they wondered how long OPEC can retain its unity if buyer resistance continues. Stephen Hanke, chief economist at Friedburg Commodity Management, said OPEC production was lower \"because of the Saudi cut (to 3.1 mln bpd) and this could spell trouble if it gives other members an incentive to exceed their quotas.\" He added, \"The Saudis will be picking up the tab for other members who produce over their quota, and the drain on the Saudis will continue, forcing them to cut output maybe as low as 2.5 mln bpd to support the 18 dlrs average price,\" he added. There are also signs of some OPEC crudes being sold in the spot market at below OPEC official prices, traders said. Oil traders said Nigerian Brass River sold for delivery into the U.S. Gulf at a price related to North Sea brent, which traded this week at 17.60 dlrs, far below the official price of 18.92 dlrs for the similar quality Bonny Light. Iranian oil is also surfacing in the U.S. Gulf and the Far East at reported discounts to its 17.50 dlrs official price. \"There is a lot of oil priced on government-to-government deals, which are below official prices and this is probably being resold,\" one international trader said. IRANIAN OIL MINISTER ARRIVES IN ALGERIA Iranian Oil Minister Gholamreza Aqazadeh arrived in Algiers at the head of a large delegation for talks on stabilizing oil prices, the official news agency APS said. In a brief arrival statement, he said Iran and Algeria were engaged in \"continuous and stronger cooperation\" on the world petroleum market and had \"deployed considerable efforts to stablise petroleum prices.\" He was greeted on arrival by Belkacem Nabi, the Algerian Minister of Energy, Chemical and Petro-Chemical Industries. POSITIVE OUTLOOK TEMPERED IN U.S. DEBT FUTURES Higher oil prices and stronger than expected U.S. employment growth led to sharp losses in U.S. interest rate futures and diminished what had been a positive chart outlook, financial analysts said. The increase of 319,000 in non-farm payroll employment during February was above market expectations for a rise of 170,000 to 200,000 jobs and sparked selling in Treasury bond futures that drove the June contract through key technical support at 101-2/32 at the opening Friday, they noted. \"I don\\'t like that fact that we had a close below 101,\" said Prudential Bache analyst Fred Leiner. The 101-2/32 level in the June bond contract had been the top of a three-month trading range, which when penetrated during the rally Wednesday led to bullish forecasts by chartists. But analysts called it a false breakout on the weekly charts when the June bond closed at 100-10/32 Friday. Some also forecast that the high of the week at 101-19/32 may signal a bearish double top formation portending steep losses. \"I tend to go along with the double top scenario,\" said Northern Futures analyst Eileen Rico. Rico noted that the possible formation, along with the fact that the rally of the last two weeks in bond futures has occurred on relatively low volume, were negative signals. Despite what could be a negative chart outlook, Leiner remains cautiously optimistic, and June bonds should find support between 100 and 99-16/32 next week. The optimistic outlook, as well as Leiner\\'s expectation that the yield curve will flatten in the near term, is based on an improving inflation outlook. With the dollar stable and economic data giving the Federal Reserve little room to ease monetary policy, \"the inflation outlook is improving,\" Leiner said, and that should lead to relatively stronger bond prices than bill and Eurodollar prices. Still, Leiner noted that the recent rise in oil prices remains a concern for the inflation outlook. Oil rose during the week on reports that OPEC nations were maintaining production quotas and official prices, and got an extra boost Friday due to the suspension of oil exports from Ecuador after an earthquake Thursday. \"The runup in crude oil will be a short-lived phenomenon,\" said Carroll McEntee and McGinley analyst Brian Singer. The rise in oil prices over the past week has been largely \"media induced,\" Singer said. He noted that even though OPEC production may be within quotas, \"oil stocks are at tremendously high levels.\" Although the Ecuador situation could cause a delay, oil prices will eventually decline to the lows of late February, he said, and that will be a supportive influence for bond prices. ECUADOR ADOPTS AUSTERITY MEASURES AFTER QUAKE OPEC member Ecuador adopted austerity measures to conserve fuel after oil production was paralyzed by a strong earthquake. Energy and Mines Minister Javier Espinosa announced on television the country would cut domestic fuel sales by 30 pct. A ministry statement had earlier announced indefinite suspension of crude oil exports, declaring force majeure. Deputy Energy Minister Fernando Santos Alvite told a television interviewer that it could possibly take more than a month to repair Ecuador\\'s main pipeline linking Amazon basin oil fields to the Pacific Ocean coast. The quake on Thursday, which registered six on the 12-point Mercalli scale, killed at least six people and was centred near the Reventador volcano about 90 km (50 miles) east of Quito. Ecuador had recently been pumping 260,000 barrels per day. The government\\'s austerity measures ban the sale of aviation fuel to foreign airliners on international routes and no fuel will be available for ships owned by foreign lines. Ecuador also banned the sale of petrol on weekends and holidays and limited sales on weekdays, an Energy and Mines Ministry communique said. IRAQ-TURKEY OIL PIPELINE CUT BY LANDSLIDE Turkey oil pipeline near the southern town of Adana after it was cut by a landslide, the Hurriyet and Anatolian news agencies said. Little oil was lost in the landslide Friday night because taps on the one mln bpd line were switched off after the accident, they said. The pipeline, which carries oil for Turkey and other customers from Iraq\\'s Kirkuk field to the Yumurtalik terminal on the Turkish Mediterranean coast, is Iraq\\'s main oil outlet. ECUADOR TO EXPORT NO OIL FOR FOUR MONTHS, OFFICIAL The suspension of Ecuador\\'s crude oil shipments after an earthquake cut an oil pipeline will last at least four months, a senior Energy Ministry official said. The official said Ecuador could resume exports after repairing a 40 km section of the 510 km pipeline, which links jungle oil fields at Lago Agrio to Balao on the Pacific coast. It would take about 100 mln U.S. Dlrs to repair the pipeline, the official, who did not want to be named, told Reuters. Ecuador had enough oil to meet domestic demand for about 35 days and would have to import crude to supplement stocks. The earthquake last Thursday night registered six on the 12-point international Mercalli scale. The damage to the pipeline was a severe economic blow to Ecuador, where oil accounts for up to two-thirds of total exports and as much as 60 pct of government revenues. Financially pressed Ecuador, a member of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), was recently pumping about 260,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude, about 50,000 bpd above the output quota assigned by the cartel, another Energy Ministry spokesman said. Last year, it exported an average of 173,500 bpd, according to the central bank. However, Ecuador might build an emergency 25 km pipeline, costing 15 to 20 mln dlrs, to hook up with a Colombian pipeline, the first official said. He estimated it could take about 60 days to build. Ecuador, squeezed by the slide in world oil prices in 1986, had only 138 mln dlrs in net international reserves at the end of January, about equal to one month\\'s imports. It suspended interest payments in January on 5.4 billion dlrs owed to about 400 private foreign banks. The country\\'s total foreign debt is 8.16 billion dlrs, the eighth largest in Latin America. In Caracas, President Jaime Lusinchi said Venezuela would loan five mln barrels of crude to Ecuador over the next three months to make up for losses from damage to the pipeline. Ecuador asked for the loan to guarantee domestic supplies and would ship an equivalent volume back to Venezuela in repayment in May, Lusinchi said. A commission headed by Venezuelan Investment Fund Minister Hector Hurtado and including representatives from the interior and defence ministries and the state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela will travel to Ecuador Tuesday to evaluate and co-ordinate an emergency relief program, he said. IRAN SELLING DISCOUNTED CRUDE, JAPAN TRADERS SAY Japanese customers have bought nearly six mln barrels of crude oil from the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) at a substantial discount to the official price, and Western traders have received even larger discounts, Japanese traders involved in the transactions told Reuters. NIOC has sold its crude for March shipment to Japanese customers with different formulas. One company has bought 800,000 barrels of Iranian Heavy at a straight discount of 30-35 cents below the official price, the sources said. Other deals have been fixed with prices linked to Oman and Dubai spot prices less a discount, they said. Iran\\'s discounted sales have not, however, managed to reverse the bullish tone in the crude oil and products spot markets, oil traders said. Market sentiment is being influenced more by the colder weather in Europe, and reports that OPEC\\'s February output was below its self-imposed quota of 15.8 mln barrels per day. Firmer gas oil on the London futures, and more bullish sentiment on the New York Mercantile Exchange futures market are supporting spot price levels, they said. Another Japanese trading house has paid the official price but through a processing arrangement will effectively receive a discount, the sources said. \"It\\'s just disguised cheating,\" one Japanese trader said. The sources said only one Japanese company had paid the official price for Iranian oil. It has purchased 1.5 mln barrels of Iranian Heavy for April shipment for refining in Singapore. They said about nine VLCCs of Iranian crude have been sold to Western traders with pricing based 60 pct on the official price and 40 pct on spot prices, or with part of the price related to processing arrangements. AMOCO REPORTS SOUTH CHINA SEA OIL FIND The U.S. &lt;Amoco Petroleum Corp> has reported an offshore oil find at its Pearl River basin concession in the South China Sea, the New China News Agency said. It said the Liu Hua 11-1-1 A well produced at around 2,240 barrels per day at a depth of 305 metres. The news agency said Amoco plans to drill a second well in the area this year, but gave no further details. API REPORTS SHARP FALL IN DRILLINGS Estimated oil and gas drilling completions in the United States dropped by almost 41 per cent in 1986 from 1985, the American Petroleum Institute said. API, an industry group, said that of the 42,387 wells completed last year, a total of 19,741 were oil wells, 8,645 were natural gas wells and 14,001 were dry holes. In 1985, a total of 71,539 wells were drilled - 36,834 oil wells, 13,036 gas wells and 21,669 dry holes. BRAZILIAN SEAFARERS\\' STRIKE DAMAGES OIL EXPORTS A strike by Brazil\\'s 40,000 seafarers who want pay rises of up to 180 pct may have cost the state-owned oil company Petrobras 20 mln dlrs in lost export orders, the company\\'s commercial director Arthur de Carvalho was quoted as saying in press reports. More than 170 ships in Brazil, and about nine more in foreign ports, have been halted by the strike, which began on February 27. Marines began blockading the ships on Friday after the strike was ruled illegal, and some strikers are running short of food, National Merchants Marine Union president Edson Areias said.

OECD TRADE, GROWTH SEEN SLOWING IN 1987 The 24 nations of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), hampered by sluggish industrial output and trade, face slower economic growth, and their joint balance of payments will swing into deficit in 1987, the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU ) said. The EIU said in its World Trade Forecast it revised OECD economic growth downwards to 2.5 pct this year, compared with a 2.8 pct growth forecast in December. It said the new areas of weakness are West Germany and the smaller European countries it influences, and Japan, hardest hit by currency appreciation this year. The independent research organisation cut its 1987 growth rate forecasts for West Germany to 2.2 pct from 3.2 pct in December and to 2.3 pct from three pct for Japan. It said it expected the OECD to post a current account deficit of some 13 billion dlrs in both 1987 and 1988, due in large part to a 1.50 dlrs a barrel rise in 1987 oil prices. It said the U.S. Current account deficit looked likely to fall even more slowly than forecast, to 125 billion dlrs in 1987 and 115 billion in 1988 from 130 billion in 1986. It said it expected West Germany to post a 31 billion dlr payments surplus and Japan a 76 billion dlr surplus this year. The EIU said it saw oil prices dropping to around 16.50 dlrs a barrel by end-1987 and 15.50 dlrs in 1988 from about 18 dlrs last year, as adherence to OPEC output policy becomes increasingly ragged. It said the dollar is poised to resume its decline in foreign exchange markets, and will lose a further 13 pct on its trade-weighted index this year and five pct in 1988 after last year\\'s 18.4 pct drop. The average mark/dollar rate is put at 1.80 marks this year and 1.70 in 1988 while the yen/dollar rate is expected to break through the 150 yen barrier with an average value of 150 yen in 1987 and 146 yen in 1988, it said. \"This is not a crash scenario but the dollar\\'s steeper angle of descent increases the risk of ending with a fireball rather than a three-point landing,\" the EIU said. \"Talking will not stop the dollar\\'s slide for long and the February meeting (of finance ministers of the Group of Five and Canada) produced scant promise of either a decisive shift to more expansive policies in West Germany and Japan, or a tighter U.S. Fiscal policy,\" it said. It said the key to the dollar\\'s fortunes was the willingness of Japanese institutions to buy U.S. Government assets despite prospects of sustaining a currency loss. \"Thus far they have been willing,\" the EIC said, adding that if Japan was deterred from buying U.S. Bonds the dollar would collapse. To contain such a currency crisis, dollar interest rates would have to soar, bringing recession and a Third World debt crisis, it said. On trade, the EIU said prospects for 1987 look \"increasingly sick.\" Import growth, forecast in December at 4.5 pct, is now seen slowing down to around 3.8 pct in 1987 with a recovery only to 4.2 pct in 1988, it said. The weakness of the West German economy is the biggest single factor, with import growth there expected to feature a sluggish 3.5 pct growth in 1987 against the 6.5 pct forecast in December, the EIU said. On the export side, it said it saw weak demand in West Germany affecting export prospects elsewhere in Europe, while Japan\\'s exports in 1987 would remain flat and sales by U.S. Exporters would respond only marginally to a lower, more competitively-priced dollar. It said in most of Europe and in Japan, raw materials and oil will cost less in domestic currency in 1987 than in 1986. However, rates of inflation will edge up in 1988 to over the current OECD average of three pct. Non-oil commodity prices will show a modest dollar price increase in 1988 for the first time since 1984, the EIU said. After a rise of 18 pct in 1986, the dollar price of internationally traded manufactures will go up by 8.5 pct in 1987 and by five pct in 1988, it said. It said OECD industrial production would rise by only 1.6 pct in 1987 after a weak 1.5 pct increase in 1986. PETRO-CANADA TO DRILL TWO TERRA NOVA TEST WELLS Petro-Canada, Canada\\'s state-owned oil company, said it will drill two delineation wells this summer at the Terra Nova oil field offshore Newfoundland. Evaluation of test results and preliminary engineering work should put Petro-Canada in a position to propose a development plan for the Terra Nova field in 1988, the company said. Depending on time required for regulatory approvals, construction could begin in 1989, with first oil production as early as 1991, Petro-Canada said. \"We have a high degree of confidence that the western portion of the (Terra Nova) field contains at least 11 mln cubic meters of recoverable oil, or more than 70 mln barrels, and that we could produce it economicly using a floating production system,\" Petro-Canada said. The Terra-Nova field, lying 350 kilometers east of St. John\\'s and 35 kilometers southeast of Hibernia field, was discovered by Petro-Canada in 1984. \"We\\'ve had encouraging results from the eastern portion of the field, and we hope this summer\\'s drilling will prove up additional reserves there,\" the company said. Petro-Canada believes Terra Nova field is a good commercial prospect and the company wants to move some of those resources towards development so it can start generating a return on investments, Petro-Canada said. Petro-Canada, which will act as operator of the two wells, has a 75 pct interest in the western portion of Graven block of the Terra Nova field and a 26 pct interest in the field\\'s East Flank block, a company spokesman said later. Other field participants include Canterra Energy Ltd, Mobil Oil Canada Ltd, Gulf Canada Resources Inc, ICG Resources Ltd, Trillium Exploration Corp and general partnership PAREX. Petro-Canada estimates reserves in the Terra Nova field\\'s Graven block of between 68 mln and 70 mln barrels of oil, company spokesman Bob Foulkes said from Petro-Canada\\'s Calgary office. Combined reserves for Graven Block and the field\\'s East Flank block are estimated between 70 mln and 130 mln barrels, he added. Petro-Canada expects to spend about 500 mln Canadian dlrs to bring the field to production by about 1991, and the development budget could double if the company builds a production system combining both blocks in the field, he said. Petro-Canada estimates the Terra Nova field Graven block would produce between 25,000 and 26,000 barrels average daily production, with a production system that would have maximum capacity of 40,000 bpd, company spokesman Foulkes said in answer to a query. The company estimates a production system combining both Graven and East Flank blocks in the Terra Nova field could produce about 45,000 bpd average daily production, he said. RANGER &lt;RGO> COMPLETES U.S. PROPERTY SALE Ranger Oil Ltd said it completed on March 2 the previously announced sale of its U.S. oil and gas properties held by subsidiaries Ranger Oil Co and Ranger Inc to Ampol Exploration Ltd, of Australia, for 18.5 mln U.S. dlrs. Ranger said that under the deal, it would retain a five pct gross overriding royalty on its stake from blocks east cameron 65 and 82 in the Gulf of Mexico offshore Lousiana. It said the sale did not include U.S. properties acquired from &lt;Berkeley Exploration and Production PLC> last December. AMOCO\\'S FIRST SOUTH CHINA SEA EXPLORATORY WELL FLOWS 2,240 BARRELS OF OIL DAILY AMOCO\\'S FIRST SOUTH CHINA SEA EXPLORATORY WELL FLOWS 2,240 BARRELS OF OIL DAILY SHELL CANADA SAID IT RAISED CRUDE PRICES BY 47 CANADIAN CTS A BARREL TODAY SHELL CANADA SAID IT RAISED CRUDE PRICES BY 47 CANADIAN CTS A BARREL TODAY HAMILTON OIL &lt;HAML> SAYS RESERVES RISE Hamilton Oil Corp said reserves at the end of 1986 were 59.8 mln barrels of oil and 905.5 billion cubic feet of natural gas, or 211 mln barrels equivalent, up 10 mln equivalent barrels from a year before. GRAHAM-MCCORMICK &lt;GOP> SELLS OIL AND GAS STAKE Graham-McCormick Oil and Gas Partnership said it completed the sale of interests in two major oil and gas fields to &lt;Energy Assets International Corp> for 21 mln dlrs. The company said it sold about one-half of its 50 pct interest in the Oak Hill and North Rucias fields, its two largest producing properties. It said it used about 20 mln dlrs of the proceeds to prepay principal on its senior secured notes. Semi-annual principal payments on the remaining 40 mln dlrs of notes have been satisfied until December 1988 as a result, it said. The company said the note agreements were amended to reflect an easing of some financial covenants, and an increase of interest to 13.5 pct from 13.0 pct until December 1990. It said the noteholders exercise price for 1,125,000 warrants was also reduced to 50 cts from 1.50 dlrs. The company said Energy Assets agreed to share the costs of increasing production at the Oak Hill field. SHELL CANADA &lt;SHC> RAISED CRUDE OIL POSTINGS Shell Canada, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Royal Dutch/Shell Group &lt;RD> said that it raised crude oil prices by about 47 Canadian cts a barrel today. The increase riased its posted price for Light sweet crude oil to 21.95 dlrs a barrel from its march one level. Light sour crudes were raised to 19.95 dlrs a barrel, the company said. FITZWATER SAYS REAGAN STRONGLY AGAINST TAX HIKE White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said President Reagan\\'s record in opposing tax hikes is \"long and strong\" and not about to change. \"We\\'re opposed to tax increases.... We will fight tax increases.... We will deal with it politically in every forum possible,\" said Fitzwater when questioned about whether there was any change in the administration\\'s position. Fitzwater said Reagan\\'s strong feelings against a tax hike included opposition to an oil import fee. \"The President\\'s position is that he is opposed to it,\" he said. CANADIAN OIL COMPANIES RAISE CRUDE PRICES Petro-Canada, the state-owned oil company, said it raised the contract price it will pay for crude oil 64 Canadian cts a barrel, effective March six. Petro-Canada\\'s posted price for the benchmark light sweet grade, Edmonton/Swann Hills at 40 api gravity, now stands at 21.95 Canadian dlrs/bbl. Their light sour grade is posted at 19.88 Canadian dlrs/bbl. Earlier today, Shell Canada &lt;SHC> said it raised its crude postings about 47 Canadian cts/bbl, bringing Edmonton light sweet to 21.95 Canadian dlrs/bbl, and the light sour crude to 19.95 Canadian dlrs/bbl. Imperial oil &lt;IMO.A>, a 70 pct owned subsidiary of Exxon Corp, said that effective March five it also raised its light sweet crude posting to 21.95 Canadian dlrs/bbl. ECUADOR QUAKE TO CUT OIL REVENUES 800 MLN DLRS up to 300 people were feared dead and more than 15,000 people left homeless by thursday\\'s earthquake, which will cost Ecuador close to 800 mln dlrs in lost petroleum revenues, authorities said. They estimated the cost of repairing a damaged oil pipeline at 150 mln dlrs. \"the magnitude of the damages caused by the earthquake is gigantic,\" president leon febres cordero said after inspecting the damages in napo, the hardest-hit jungle province, 100 miles from here. The quake damaged 40 km of an oil pipeline, forcing this opec nation to suspend crude exports for four months, president febres cordero said in a statement issued today by the presidential press office. The country would lose an estimated 800 mln dlrs in crude exports until the pipeline was repaired, the president said. It would cost 150 mln dlrs to repair the pipelline which carries oil from jungle oil fields over the andes to Balao, a pacific ocean port. Crude traditionally accounts for up to two-thirds of ecuador\\'s exports. the quake triggered landslides, swelling the aguarico river which burst it banks carrying away homes and huts in napo province, health minister jorge brancho told reuters. \"we fear that up to 300 people died in napo though there is no way of now knowing the exact figure because many people have disappeared,\" he said. Other estimates ranged as high as 500 dead. So far 20 corpses have been recovered, bracho said. Information Minister Marco Lara told reporters: \"the number of dead and injured is not known ... because we do not know how many people lived in the homes hit by the landslides.\" Bracho said at least 15,000 were left homeless in the cayambe district. USX &lt;X> UNIT RAISES SOME CRUDE POSTINGS Marathon Petroleum Company, a subsidiary of USX Corp &lt;X>, said it raised the contract price it pays for three grades of crude oil, effective March 6. Illinois Sweet and Indiana Sweet are both being raised 50 cts a barrel to 16.75 dlrs/bbl, and the Southern Michigan grade is being raised 25 cts/bbl, also to 16.75 dlrs a bbl. The West Texas Intermediate grade was unchanged. CONOCO RAISES CRUDE OIL PRICES UP TO ONE DLR BARREL, WTI AT 17.50 DLRS CONOCO RAISES CRUDE OIL PRICES UP TO ONE DLR BARREL, WTI AT 17.50 DLRS API PRESIDENT SEES OPTIONS TO AVERT OIL CRISIS American Petroleum Institute President Charles DiBona said no options should be rejected to combat growing U.S. dependence on foreign oil. \"No action should be ruled out--import fees or quotas, floor prices, tax incentives or other alternatives--while a national dialogue on the issue continues,\" DiBona said at a paper institute conference in New York today. DiBona said there is no unanimity within the industry on how to stimulate energy production but there is consensus on removing several government policies that hinder investments in new prospects. DiBona said the windfall profit tax should be abolished immediately and current proposals for increased environmental regulations on acid rain and waste disposal should be not adopted. He also suggested that the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska should be opened up for leasing to oil companies, DiBona said. \"This is a battle the industry cannot afford to lose if the nation is to continue to benefit from Alaskan oil,\" DiBona said. Since 1986 U.S. oil production has fallen while consumption rose and that has raised dependence on imported oil, particularly from OPEC, DiBona said. DUPONT &lt;DD> UNIT RAISES CRUDE OIL PRICES Conoco Inc, a subsidiary of DuPont Corp, said it was increasing its contract prices for crude oil between 10 cts and one dlr a barrel, effective today. Conoco said the increase brings its price for the U.S. benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate to 17.50 dlrs a barrel, up one dlr. South Louisiana Sweet, also up one dlr, is now 17.85 dlrs. West Texas Sour was up 10 cts to 16.60 dlrs a barrel. Conoco was the last company to raise prices following a series of increases initiated last week by Sun Co &lt;SUN>, which reversed the posted price cuts made at the end of February. PICKENS SEES CONTINUED SLUMP IN WORKING RIGS T. Boone Pickens, the Texas oilman and financier, said he believes the heady days the oil service industry had in the early 1980s, when over 4,500 oil rigs were once reported operating, will not return in his lifetime. Pickens told Reuters he expects the rig count to drop to below 600 before recovering. He added that oil prices will eventually rise to 35 dlrs, then to 50 dlrs after 1990. Currently, some 700 oil rigs are operating in the U.S., down sharply after oil prices slipped from 30 dlrs in late 1985 to around 10 dlrs in 1986. Prices are now around 18 dlrs. The highest number of working rigs was 4,500 in December 1981. \"The rigs won\\'t go back to work until the price of oil gets above 30 dlrs,\" he said, adding that while he expects to see 50 dlr a barrel oil, he does not expect to see 2,000 rigs operating in his lifetime. Pickens is 58. Pickens, who is currently touring the country promoting his autobiography \"Boone,\" said he does not believe the U.S. should impose an oil import fee in order to stimulate the domestic oil industry. IRANIAN OIL MINISTER IN UAE TALKS Iranian Oil Minister Gholamreza Aqazadeh is in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to discuss oil prices and the general market situation, Iranian officials accompanying him said. He will meet UAE President Sheikh Zaid bin Sultan al-Nahayan and Oil Minister Mana Said al-Oteiba. Aqazadeh arrived last night after a brief stopover in Riyadh, where he met Saudi Arabia\\'s Oil Minister Hisham Nazir. The official Saudi Press Agency quoted him as saying his talks at Riyadh with Nazir had been constructive and good. Aqazadeh said Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) members were agreed on holding production stable and he reiterated the importance of maintaining oil prices. OPEC members agreed in December to limit production to 15.8 mln barrels per day for the first half of this year and on a benchmark price of 18 dlrs a barrel from February 1. Aqazadeh also visted OPEC members Gabon, Algeria and Libya. The Iranian news agency, IRNA, quoted him as saying before leaving Tripoli that OPEC should do everything possible to make oil prices permanently stable. SAUDI ARABIA\\'S KING FAHD WANTS STABLE OIL PRICES King Fahd said today Saudi Arabia wants oil price stability and he called on non-OPEC producers to avoid harmful competition with the 13 nation group. His plea, in an interview with Reuters and the television news agency Visnews, came ahead of a state visit he will make to Britain later this month. King Fahd was asked whether Saudi Arabia would be prepared to reduce its oil output below its OPEC quota of 4.133 mln barrels per day (bpd) to defend the 18 dlr benchmark price agreed to by OPEC last December. The King replied: \"Saudi Arabia doesn\\'t decide prices by itself but certainly desires price stability.\" Non-OPEC countries \"must help us in a framework of common interest so that there is no type of competition which could prove harmful to everyone,\" he said. Asked if he saw the 18 dlr per barrel benchmark as a first step towards higher world oil prices, King Fahd said it was not for Saudi Arabia but for all OPEC countries to determine such issues. Iran and Algeria have already called for a higher benchmark. In recent weeks the 18 dlr level has come under pressure, due partly to quota violations by some OPEC members. King Fahd said Saudi Arabia, the world\\'s largest oil exporter, was adhering to decisions made at OPEC\\'s December conference which set a 15.8 mln bpd output ceiling for the first half of 1987. A major non-OPEC producer, Britain has so far resisted the group\\'s pleas to curb its North Sea oil output. The King also urged the world community to help the Palestinians return to their homeland and called for a peaceful end to the Iran-Iraq war. The 6-1/2-year-old war could not be resolved on the battlefield, he said. GULF ARAB DEPUTY OIL MINISTERS TO MEET IN BAHRAIN Deputy oil ministers from six Gulf Arab states will meet in Bahrain today to discuss coordination of crude oil marketing, the official Emirates news agency WAM reported. WAM said the officials would be discussing implementation of last Sunday\\'s agreement in Doha by Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) oil ministers to help each other market their crude oil. Four of the GCC states - Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Kuwait and Qatar - are members of the Organiaation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and some face stiff buyer resistance to official OPEC prices. OIL FIRMS CUT 1987 INDONESIAN EXPLORATION SPENDING Foreign oil companies will spend less on exploration in Indonesia this year than last, budgeting 2.7 billion dlrs for calendar 1987 against 1986 spending of 2.8 billion dlrs, the state oil company Pertamina said. Actual spending last year fell short of the budgeted figure of 3.2 billion dlrs, as oil companies slashed expenditure because of the crash in world oil prices. Jumardi Jukardi, head of Pertamina\\'s coordinating board for foreign contractors, said foreign companies will drill 110 exploration wells and 431 development wells this year, against 108 and 330 last year. INDONESIA OIL CONTRACT NEGOTIATIONS END THIS MONTH Negotiations between Indonesia\\'s state oil company Pertamina and foreign oil contractors on extension of the standard 30-year production sharing contract will be concluded by the end of this month, a Pertamina official said. Jumardi Jukardi, head of Pertamina\\'s foreign contractors coordinating board, gave no details about the outcome of the talks. But Pertamina President Abdul Rachman Ramly has said priority will be given to extending contracts for companies whose exploration and production contracts expire within the next seven to 10 years. Jukardi, speaking to Indonesian reporters, said the negotiations would determine whether the 85-15 production sharing split in favour of Pertamina would be adhered to or altered in some cases as oil companies are asking for. Hardjoko Seputro, spokesman for the Mines and Energy Ministry, has said that President Suharto has agreed in principle to extension of the standard 30-year production sharing contract to reflect better current depressed conditions on the international oil market. SAUDI ARABIA REITERATES COMMITMENT TO OPEC ACCORD Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Hisham Nazer reiterated the kingdom\\'s commitment to last December\\'s OPEC accord to boost world oil prices and stabilize the market, the official Saudi Press Agency SPA said. Asked by the agency about the recent fall in free market oil prices, Nazer said Saudi Arabia \"is fully adhering by the ... accord and it will never sell its oil at prices below the pronounced prices under any circumstance.\" Saudi Arabia was a main architect of December pact under which OPEC agreed to cut its total oil output ceiling by 7.25 pct and return to fixed prices of around 18 dollars a barrel. KUWAIT MINISTER SAYS NO EMERGENCY OPEC TALKS SET Kuwait\\'s oil minister said in a newspaper interview that there were no plans for an emergency OPEC meeting after the recent weakness in world oil prices. Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah was quoted by the local daily al-Qabas as saying that \"none of the OPEC members has asked for such a meeting.\" He also denied that Kuwait was pumping above its OPEC quota of 948,000 barrels of crude daily (bpd). Crude oil prices fell sharply last week as international oil traders and analysts estimated the 13-nation OPEC was pumping up to one million bpd over its self-imposed limits. ECUADOR CRUDE OIL EXPORTS STOPPED FOR FIVE MONTHS Ecuador needs 120 mln dlrs to repair the damage to its oil export pipeline caused by last week\"s earthquake, which will stop crude exports for five months, energy and mines minister Javier Espinosa Teran said. Espinosa said yesterday the pipeline, which carries crude from jungle fields to the Pacific Ocean coast of Balao, would be repaired with the help of Texaco Inc &lt;TX.N> and a Mexican and an Argentine firm. President Leon Febres Cordero said two days ago that Ecuador, an OPEC member, would have to suspend crude exports for four months due to the quake. Oil traditionally accounts for up to two-thirds of Ecuador\\'s total exports and as much as 60 pct of government revenues. Deputy energy minister Fernando Santos Alvite said Ecuador would have to import six to seven mln barrels of crude oil to meet its needs until the line was repaired. The Ecuadorean minister at the Presidency, Patricio Quevedo, told reporters that Venezuela will lend Ecuador five mln barrels of crude, which would repaid in kind after a 180-day period. He added the Caracas-based Andean Development Corp had granted a loan of 11.7 mln dlrs towards repairing the pipeline, 50 km of which had been damaged in the quake. In Quito, Foreign Minister Rafael Garcia Velasco yesterday summoned ambassadors from about 40 countries to whom he issued appeal for emergency aid for the country. Only three countries, the U.S., Colombia and Venezuela, had offered assistance. TALKING POINT/OIL SERVICES TURNAROUND SEEN The oil services industry is on the verge of a recovery because of rising crude prices, oil industry analysts said. The analysts, who issued buy recommendations on some stocks, said the recovery in oil services should begin in the second half of 1987, after drilling activity bottoms out in the first half, and continue into the next decade. \"People, however, cannot afford to wait for drilling to go up to start buying,\" said Sandi Haber Sweeney, senior research analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein and Co Inc. Among the recommended buys are Schlumberger Ltd &lt;SLB>, Halliburton Co &lt;HAL>, Dresser Industries &lt;DI>, Baker International &lt;BKO>, and McDermott International Inc &lt;MDR>, which may be the target of a takeover by Harold Simmons, a Dallas-based investor. Analysts said although major oil companies are increasing exploration and development overseas, they expect the pickup in oil services will begin in the U.S. \"Activity in the U.S. is so depressed it should move up faster,\" said Vishnu Sharp of Goldman Sachs. The number of active oil drilling rigs in the U.S. was 766 last week compared with 1,212 rigs one year ago, Huges Tool Co &lt;HT> figures show. The average number of working rigs in the U.S. for 1987 is projected at 978 versus 964 in 1986, according to Ike Kerridge, vice president of stockholder relations at Hughes Tool. \"The first significant pickup in drilling activity will occur in the second half of 1988,\" Kerridge said. Overseas drilling activity is expected to follow a similar pattern, Kerridge said. \"Halliburton is the best value,\" said Jeffrey Freedman, vice president at Smith Barney, Harris and Upham Inc, adding the company controls the greatest amount of liquidity of common stock market value, is diversifed in non-oil field businesess, and has the lowest multiple of stock price to operating cash flow including debt. Schlumberger is Freedman\\'s second favorite oil service stock. \"Schlumberger is expected to continue to be the dominant technical leader in the industry,\" Freedman said. \"Schlumberger\\'s management shift, asset restructuring, including a pending merger of Fairchild Semiconductor, and its considerable cash horde sets the stage for the company to maximize its significant industry advantage and capitalize on the project upturn in exploration and development activity,\" according to a report by George Gaspar, first vice president at Robert W. Baird and Co Inc. Gaspar estimates earnings per share for Schlumberger at 25 cts for 1987 and one to 1.75 dlrs in 1988 compared with 20 cts in 1986 excluding a fourth quarter special charge of 1.87 billion dlrs. Bernstein\\'s Sandi Sweeney is recommending a group of oil service companies and said choosing among them is difficult. Her favorite is Baker International, which is involved in a possible merger with Hughes Tool Co. Dresser Industries will also benefit from the recovery but possibly not as much as other companies because it is not a pure service company, Sweeney said. Dresser is expected to improve profitability owing to cost reductions and streamlined operations, including the sale and leaseback of its headquarters, said Swarup. OPEC REAFFIRMS COMMITMENT TO FIXED PRICES, CEILING OPEC has reaffirmed its commitment to fixed crude oil prices of around 18 dlrs a barrel and an overall output ceiling of 15.8 mln barrels per day (bpd) to defend prices, its president Rilwanu Lukman said. He told a news conference here \"After due consultation with my colleagues in OPEC, I hereby wish to emphasize that Nigeria and all member countries of OPEC remain determined to uphold the December agreement by adhering strictly to their various quotas and official selling prices.\" Lukman added no extraordinary OPEC conference was planned. \"We are in a position to re-confirm that, despite misleading news in foreign media to the contrary, ... OPEC member countries as a whole produced below their agreed quota in the month of February,\" Lukman, who is Nigerian oil minister, said. Lukman put the overall OPEC output shortfall in February at 900,000 bpd and said this was as a result of their firm determination to defend official selling prices of 18 dlrs agreed upon last December in Geneva. The December agreement set an overall output ceiling for OPEC of 15.8 mln bpd for first half 1987 and restored fixed prices as from February 1 around a reference point of 18 dlrs. Oil prices rallied immediately after the Geneva accord but fell again last month on reports that OPEC was producing more than the agreed level. \"The idea was to suggest that OPEC\\'s agreement would not hold and this caused some customers to hold back purchases of OPEC oil and resort to destocking to meet their needs,\" Lukman said. He said the 900,000 bpd shortfall last February was based on the verified figure for 10 out of OPEC\\'s 13 members, adding that Nigeria alone had a shortfall in production of 100,000 bpd. Iraq disassociated itself from the December agreement, while the production figures of Ecuador and the United Arab Emirates needed to be verified, Lukman said. \"If that is the price we have to pay to make the agreement succeed, we are ready ... OPEC is not changing its price level of 18 dlrs,\" the group\\'s president said. He said the OPEC price differentials committee meeting formerly postponed to April had been put off indefinitely. \"Furthermore, no extraordinary meeting of the conference is at the moment contemplated since most agreements reached in December are being adhered to,\" he said. Asked if the committee did not need to meet soon to narrow the gaps in the prices of the various OPEC crudes -- fixed in relation to the 18 dlr benchmark -- Lukman replied \"We consider the defence of our prices much more crucial than differentials.\" Lukman said OPEC was aware that consumers had heavily drawn on stocks of both crude oil and refined products to levels well below this time last year and soon they would return to the market in search of crude. \"We don\\'t see that there is going to be any difficulty in maintaining the 18 dlr price throughout the rest of the year,\" Lukman said. The OPEC president praised non-OPEC oil producers, which he said had contributed to the group\\'s efforts to stabilise prices, but he criticised Britain for maintaining its long-held view not to do anything to help the market. \"We are quite confident, however, that in the long-term with two-thirds of the world\\'s reserves in OPEC hands, the future is ours. We will use that advantage responsibly,\" he said. Lukman described the disruption in Ecuador\\'s output following an earthquake as tragic, but refused to say if the South American country would be allowed a higher output quota when it recovered from the disaster. TRITON ENERGY &lt;OIL> AFFILIATE IN CANADIAN FIND Triton Energy Corp said its 70 pct owned &lt;Canadian Worldwide Energy Ltd> affiliate\\'s Lasmo et al Tableland 4-36-2-10W2 well in Saskatchewan flowed 567 barrels of 37 degree gravity oil through a 17/64 inch choke from depths of 8,531 to 8,548 feet and 636 barrels of oil per day through a 20/64 inch choke from depths of 8,500 to 8,507 feet. Triton said because of the well\\'s status as a deep exploratory well, production qualifies for a five-year royalty holiday under the Saskatchewan drilling incentive products. It said the well\\'s initial production is expected to be restricted to an allowable level of about 300 barrels a day, although it is capable of sustaining much higher rates. The company said London and Scottish Marine Oil PLC owns a 50 pct interest in the well and its spacing unit, Canadian Worldwide 25 pct, &lt;Saskatchewan Oil and Gas Corp> 10 pct, &lt;Interprovincial Pipeline Ltd\\'s> Home Oil Co Ltd 7.5 pct and Scurry-Rainbow Oil Ltd &lt;SRB> 7.5 pct. Triton said Royal Dutch/Shell Group\\'s &lt;RD> &lt;SC> Shell Canada Ltd &lt;SHC> affiliate retains a convertible overriding interest in the well. ECUADOR DEPUTY MINISTER SEEKS OIL AID IN VENEZUELA Ecuador\\'s deputy energy minister Fernando Santos Alvite arrived here last night for talks on further Venezuelan assistance to his country\\'s oil industry following last week\\'s earthquake, officials said. Ecuador was obliged to suspend crude oil exports for an expected five months as a result of damage to 25 miles of pipeline linking its jungle oil fields with the Pacific port of Balao. Oil normally accounts for 60 pct of its exports. Fellow OPEC member Venezuela has already agreed to lend Ecuador five mln barrels of crude, to be repaid in kind after 180 days, to help meet its domestic consumption needs. The officials could neither confirm nor deny reports that Venezuela will temporarily produce Ecuador\\'s entire OPEC quota, set at 210,000 barrels per day for first half 1987. \"All options are open at this moment in the context of cooperation on oil production,\" a Venezuelan energy and mines ministry source said. Discussions are also under way to arrive at a formula to compensate Ecuador for the loss in oil export revenue while the pipeline is repaired, officials said. Santos Alvite last night met Venezuelan energy and mines minister Arturo Hernandez Grisanti and will today hold talks at technical level, officials said. Industry sources said that among the options are for Venezuela to produce Ecuador\\'s entire quota, or for Venezuela and non-OPEC Mexico to share it and for the latter to supply Ecuador\\'s Far Eastern clients. But the ministry source said that no decision has yet been reached on the matter, and that an announcement would be made in due course. Santos Alvite said earlier in Quito that Ecuador would have to import six to seven mln barrels of crude oil to meet its needs until the line was repaired. Ecuador energy and mines minister Javier Espinosa Teran said last night his country needs 120 mln dlrs to repair the damage to the export pipeline caused by the earthquake.

PHILADELPHIA PORT CLOSED BY TANKER CRASH The port of Philadelphia was closed when a Cypriot oil tanker, Seapride II, ran aground after hitting a 200-foot tower supporting power lines across the river, a Coast Guard spokesman said. He said there was no oil spill but the ship is lodged on rocks opposite the Hope Creek nuclear power plant in New Jersey. He said the port would be closed until today when they hoped to refloat the ship on the high tide. After delivering oil to a refinery in Paulsboro, New Jersey, the ship apparently lost its steering and hit the power transmission line carrying power from the nuclear plant to the state of Delaware. ENERGY/FOREIGN INVESTORS Lured by the weakening dollar and the conviction that oil prices are poised for a rebound, European energy companies are buying up cheap U.S. oil and gas reserves to replenish their supplies, oil industry analysts said. They said owning oil reserves in a politically stable United States is good insurance against future shortages. However, the quick pace of foreign investment has heated up competition among European firms, well-heeled U.S. institutional investors and major oil companies to snare choice domestic oil properties. Strevig and Associates, a Houston firm that tracks oil and gas reserve sales, said growing interest among foreign buyers had helped push reserve prices in recent months higher. All buyers of U.S. reserves paid a median price of 6.45 dlrs a barrel of oil during the fourth quarter of 1986 for acquisitions, up from 5.33 dlrs in the third quarter and five dlrs in the second quarter, according to the firm\\'s research. \"Foreign investors have been here nibbling a long time, but we\\'re seeing new names and smaller companies coming in,\" said Arthur Smith, an oil property appraisal specialist and president of John S. Herold Inc in Greenwich, Conn. \"Europeans, especially, do not have much indigenous oil and gas and realize the tide will eventually turn in favor of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries,\" he added. Smith and other oil industry analyst and economists believe the trend in foreign investments will continue in 1987 because of the fall in value of the U.S. dollar, the perception that oil prices have hit bottom and the fact that it is cheaper to buy new reserves than to explore for them. Plenty of properties are available on the market, thanks to the need of many companies to raise cash for debt payments and general restructuring throughout the oilpatch. In two of the biggest transactions of recent months, French-owned Minatome Corp., a unit of &lt;Total Compagnie Francaise des Petroles>, spent more than 230 mln dlrs to separately acquire oil assets of Texas International &lt;TEICC> and Lear Petroleum Partners &lt;LPP>. A spokesman for Minatome said the company is searching for additional acquisitions. A partnership of two Belgian-owned firms, &lt;Petrofina S.A.> and &lt;Cometra Oil S.A.> paid 150 mln dlrs late last year to buy virtually all the exploration assets of the Williams Cos &lt;WMB>, the Oklahoma pipeline firm. But Japanese investors prefer entering into joint ventures with experienced U.S. companies to explore for new oil. Japan\\'s &lt;Nippon Oil> is a partner of Texaco Inc\\'s &lt;TX> Texaco USA in a 100 mln dlrs U.S. drilling program, and has joined with Dupont\\'s &lt;DD> Conoco Inc in a similar 135 dlrs mln deal. Most buyers said the pay-back period of a property, its geographic location and the lifting cost of the crude oil are more important factors in evaluating potential acquisitions than relying on a simple price-per-barrel formula. Rich Hodges, a Houston-based land manager representing International Oil and Gas Corp, a partnership of &lt;Preussag Corp> and &lt;C. Deilmann Inc> of West Germany, said the firm had earmarked at least 50 mln dlrs to spend on oil reserves in Texas, Oklahoma or Louisiana in the coming months. But he called that a small amount compared to the amount other investors have for acquisitions. PaineWebber\\'s Geodyne Energy Income Fund, for example, has said it plans to spend up to 300 mln dlrs on oil and gas properties. \"The competition is stiff, not only from other foreign investors but from the brokerage houses and U.S. oil companies,\" he said. \"Our company is shopping around because we feel it\\'s substantially less risky than pure exploration. If you\\'re going to take the risk inherent in exploration, you need prices higher than the current market,\" he added. In addition to the foreign investors and U.S. brokerage houses, analysts said many of the major oil companies were also competing for prime properties. Houston-based Shell Oil Co, a unit of Royal Dutch/Shell Group &lt;RD>, has been one of the most active companies in buying and selling reserves, Smith said. Since 1982, Shell has acquired two billion dlrs in new reserves, including 470 mln barrels of oil equivalent at a net cost of 2.80 dlrs a barrel, he said. \"Buying reserves is a good strategy for most of these companies,\" Smith said. \"Domestic production has dropped by one mln barrels a day because of cutbacks in drilling and it may drop by another one mln barrels a day in 1988.\" JORDAN-PETROCANADA AGREE OIL EXPLORATION PROJECT A two-year project to search for oil and gas in Jordan was agreed in Amman by Jordan\\'s Natural Resources Authority (NRA) and the Canadian company, Petrocanada International Assistance Corporation (PCIAC). The 19.1 mln dlr assistance agreement was signed by Jordan\\'s Minister of Energy Hisham al-Khatib and PCIAC chairman Peter M. Towe. PCIAC is a Canadian government corporation providing assistance to countries like Jordan to reduce their dependence on oil imports, Towe said. BRAZIL\\'S SARNEY MEETS STRIKES WITH SHOW OF FORCE With troops in place in Brazil\\'s ports and oil installations, the government of Prersident Jose Sarney today sought to end a wave of labour unrest by a show of force. Yesterday the government sent thousands of troops supported in some instances by tanks to occupy nine oil refineries and six areas of oil production. The state-oil company Petrobras requested the intervention because of a threatened strike by 55,000 oil industry employees. The government had already dispatched more than 1,000 marines to occupy the country\\'s main ports after a national seamen\\'s strike was ruled illegal last Friday. The strike by 40,000 seamen, now in its 13th day, represents a stern challenge to the government. The stoppage has delayed exports at a time when Brazil desperately needs foreign exchange. It was a deterioration in the country\\'s trade balance which precipitated Brazil\\'s current debt crisis and the decision on February 20 to suspend interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of commercial debt. There was no sign today of an early end to the seamen\\'s strike, which has badly hit the port of Santos -- the most important in South America -- and the country\\'s other main ports. Small groups of marines armed with submachineguns stand on the quays near the strike-bound ships, but the military presence here is generally discreet. A total of 800 marines are inside the docks but most are out of sight. Yesterday marines and police occupied one ship, the Docemarte, seamen\\'s leaders said. After explaining to the captain that the strikers faced up to one year in jail because the strike was illegal, the men returned to work. One of the strike leaders, Elmano Barbosa, said \"it is a psychological war. They are using force and we are using peaceful methods.\" Port sources said only two Brazilian ships in Santos, the Docemarte and the Henrique Leal, were working. At the seamen\\'s national strike headquarters in Rio de Janeiro, spokesmen say a total of about 190 ships are strike-bound in Brazil and in foreign ports. Contradicting earlier reports from strike headquarters in Rio de Janeiro, seamen in Santos said the strikers on board ships here were not running out of food. The current labour unrest is the worst faced by Sarney\\'s civilian government since it came to power two years ago. Yesterday, in a separate protest, hundreds of thousands of farmers held rallies directed largely against high bank interest rates. The current rash of labour unrest in industry and agriculture stems from the failure of the government\\'s now-collapsed Cruzado Plan price freeze. VENEZUELA MOVES CLOSER TO CHAMPLIN PURCHASE the council of ministers approved petroleos de venezuela\\'s planned purchase of a half interest in the champlin petroleum refinery at corpus christi, texas, government sources said. The cabinet authorized energy and mines minister arturo hernandez grisanti to approve the purchase in the shareholders assembly of the state oil company petroleos de venezuela (pdvsa). Pdvsa last april 14 signed a letter of intent to buy a half interest in champlin\\'s corpus christi refinery for an undisclosed sum. Under the terms of the provisional agreement, venezuela would supply up to 160,000 barrels a day to the plant through a new company which would be jointly owned by the pdvsa and champlin, a subsidiary of the union pacific corp &lt;unp>. The deal would also allow pdvsa a joint share in champlin\\'s refinery and distribution network. The purhcase is one of a series of overseas joint ventures by which venezuela has managed to assure markets for some 400,000 barrels of its approximately 1.5 mln bpd exports. Hernandez grisanti told reporters after the cabinet meeting that pdvsa will pay 93 mln dlrs for its half ownership in the champlin refinery - 33 mln dlrs in cash and 60 mln dlrs crude oil and products. Through the deal, he said, venezuela will be assured the sale of at least 140,000 bpd of crude and products. Hernandez said pdsva has entered similar joint ventures with veba oel of west germany, nynas petroelum in sweden, and citgo in the united states. MARATHON TO RAISE CRUDE PRICES 50 CTS/BBL TOMORROW WTI  TO 17.50 DLRS MARATHON TO RAISE CRUDE PRICES 50 CTS/BBL TOMORROW WTI  TO 17.50 DLRS EIA SAYS DISTILLATE STOCKS OFF 8.8 MLN, GASOLINE OFF 500,000, CRUDE OFF 1.2 MLN EIA SAYS DISTILLATE STOCKS OFF 8.8 MLN, GASOLINE OFF 500,000, CRUDE OFF 1.2 MLN EIA SAYS DISTILLATE, GAS STOCKS OFF IN WEEK Distillate fuel stocks held in primary storage fell by 8.8 mln barrels in the week ended March six to 119.6 mln barrels, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) said. In its weekly petroleum status report, the Department of Energy agency said gasoline stocks were off 500,000 barrels in the week to 251.0 mln barrels and refinery crude oil stocks fell 1.2 mln barrels to 331.8 mln. The EIA said residual fuel stocks fell 1.5 mln barrels to 36.4 mln barrels and crude oil stocks in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) rose 200,000 barrels to 516.7 mln. The total of all crude, refined product and SPR stocks fell 10.3 mln barrels to 1,564.8, it said. USX &lt;X> UNIT TO RAISE MOST CRUDE POSTINGS USX\\'s subsidiary, Marathon Petroleum Co, said it will raise its contract prices for eleven grades of crude oil 50 cts a barrel, effective tomorrow. The increase brings Marathon\\'s posted price for West Texas Intermediate and West Texas Sour grades to 17.50 dlrs a barrel. The Light Louisiana grade was also raised 50 cts to 17.85 dlrs a barrel. RECENT U.S. OIL DEMAND UP 1.9 PCT FROM YEAR AGO U.S. oil demand as measured by products supplied rose 1.9 pct in the four weeks ended March six to 16.39 mln barrels per day from 16.08 mln in the same period a year ago, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) said. In its weekly petroleum status report, the Energy Department agency said distillate demand was down 2.2 pct in the period to 3.33 mln bpd from 3.40 mln a year earlier. Gasoline demand averaged 6.75 mln bpd, up 3.3 pct from 6.53 mln last year, while residual fuel demand was 1.40 mln bpd, off 2.7 pct from 1.43 mln, the EIA said. Domestic crude oil production was estimated at 8.38 mln bpd, down 8.5 pct from 9.15 mln a year ago, and gross daily crude imports (excluding those for the SPR) averaged 3.67 mln bpd, up 23 pct from 2.97 mln, the EIA said. Refinery crude runs in the four weeks were 12.05 mln bpd, up 1.5 pct from 11.87 mln a year earlier, it said. Year-to-date figures will not become available until March 26 when EIA\\'s Petroleum Supply Monthly data for January 1987 becomes available, the agency said. USX &lt;X> PROVED OIL, GAS RESERVES FALL IN 1986 USX Corp said proved reserves of oil and natural gas liquids fell 28 pct to 802.8 mln barrels at the end of 1986 from 1.12 billion barrels at year-end 1985. The figures, in USX\\'s just-released 1986 annual report, indicate much of the drop resulted from the exclusion of 293.7 mln barrels of Libyan reserves, after the U.S. government last June directed U.S. oil companies to end Libyan operations. USX, which owns Marathon Oil Co and Texas Oil and Gas Corp, had 60 pct of its 1986 sales of 14.94 billion dlrs from its oil and gas operations. About 24 pct of total sales came from USX\\'s USS steel unit and 16 pct from diversified businesses, which include oilfield services, raw materials, minerals, chemicals and real estate. According to the report, domestic liquids reserves fell slightly to 628.5 mln barrels from 628.9 mln and foreign reserves fell to 174.3 mln from 486.4 mln barrels. The large drop in foreign reserves was in the Middle East and Africa, where they fell to about 9.3 mln barrels from 316.7 mln, reflecting the exclusion of Libya. Total natural gas reserves fell to 4.82 trillion cubic feet at year-end 1986 from 5.18 trillion at the end of 1985. Again, most of the drop came from the Middle East and Africa, where reserves fell to zero from 71.9 billion cubic feet, excluding Libyan reserves. U.S. natural gas reserves fell to 3.44 trillion cubic feet from 3.65 trillion and foreign reserves fell to 1.38 trillion from 1.53 trillion. In other areas, USX said total capital spending fell to 962 mln dlrs in 1986 from 1.78 billion dlrs in 1985. The 1986 audited figure is eight mln dlrs higher than the unaudited figure the company reported on Jan 27. USX also said it expects to record a gain of 150 mln dlrs in 1988, representing 50 pct of previously existing investment tax credits allowable under the new tax law. The loss of the other half of the credits was reflected in the fourth quarter. In a discussion of steel results, USX said plants that were shut down last month and some previously idled plants may be permanently closed. USX took a fourth quarter charge of 1.03 billion dlrs to restructure its steel operations. The charge included the \"indefinite idling\" last month of four plants in Utah, Pennsylvania and Texas. Other plants or parts of plants in Pennsylvania, Indiana, Alabama, Ohio and Chicago had been previously idled. \"These operations are not permanently shut down. Improved market conditions for the products from these plants may make it feasible to reopen some of them,\" USX said in the report. \"On the other hand, a lack of any future market improvement may necessitate their permanent closing,\" it added. VENEZUELA TO LEND OIL TO ECUADOR FOR EXPORT venezuela will supply ecuador with an as yet undetermined amount of crude oil to help it meet export commitments, seriously affected by last week\\'s earthquake, energy and mines minister arturo hernandez grisanti said. He gave few details about the deal, but said a crude oil loan agreement will be made between state oil companies petroleos de venezuela (pdvsa) and ecuador\\'s cepe. Ecuador was forced to suspend oil exports for an expected four months after an earthquake damaged a pipeline. Oil accounts for 60 per cent of its export income. Hernandez was speaking to reporters at miraflores palace on the results of talks with ecuador\\'s deputy energy minister fernando santos alvite, who arrived here last night. \"the volume lent to ecuador would be discounted from its opec quota and would not affect venezuela\\'s,\" he said. \"we would from august on produce our own quota and sell the additional amounts that ecuador would be repaying us,\" he said. He did not elaborate on the quota arrangements but did say ecuador would notify opec by telex that venezuela would be lending it a certain amount over so many days. Venezuela\\'s opec output quota is currently 1.495 million barrels a day, and ecuador\\'s has been set at 210,000 bpd. ECUADOR TO ASK OPEC TO RAISE EXPORT QUOTA Ecuador will ask OPEC to raise its oil export quota by 100,000 barrels per day to 310,000 to compensate for lost output due to last week\\'s earthquake, deputy Energy Minister Fernando Santos Alvite said. Santos Alvite, who arrived in Caracas last night to discuss an aid plan for Ecuador, did not say when the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) would be approached. The additional output would be related to plans now under discussion for Venezuela and Mexico to lend Ecuador crude while it repairs a pipeline damaged by the quake. Earlier, Venezuelan Energy and Mines Minister Aturo Hernandez Grisanti said his country would supply an unspecified part of Ecuador\\'s export commitments. But Santos Alvite told reporters he hoped a first cargo of 300,000 barrels could leave Maracaibo this weekend to supply refineries near Guayaquil. He added Ecuador also wanted to make up for 50,000 bpd it shipped to Caribbean destinations. Mexico might supply Ecuador\\'s South Korean market. Ecuador may be unable to export oil for up to five months due to extensive damage to a 25 mile stretch of pipeline linking jungle oilfields to the Pacific port of Balao. CHINA CLOSES SECOND ROUND OF OFFSHORE OIL BIDS China has closed the second round of bidding by foreign firms for offshore oil exploration rights, the China Daily has reported. It quoted a spokesman for the China National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC) as saying China signed eight contracts with 15 foreign firms for blocks in the Pearl River mouth and south Yellow Sea covering a total area of 44,913 sq km. Second round bidding began at the end of 1984 and only one well has so far produced results -- Lufeng 13-1-1, 250 km south-east of Shenzhen, with an output of 6,770 barrels a day. The well was drilled by a group of Japanese companies. The spokesman added CNOOC was ready to enter into contracts for offshore blocks before third round bidding began. He did not say when this would be, but added the contracts would not be bound by restrictions imposed during the second round. China has signed 36 oil contracts and agreements with 37 companies from 10 countries since 1979, when offshore exploration was open to foreigners. Eleven contracts were terminated after no oil was discovered. Foreign firms have invested 2.1 billion dlrs on offshore China since 1979.

DUNE RESOURCES &lt;DNLAF> RESERVES ROSE IN 1986 Dune Resources Ltd said its oil reserves increased 225 pct during 1986 while its natural gas reserves were up six pct. The company said its proven oil reserves were estimated at 605,682 barrels on December 31, up from 186,655 barrels a year earlier boosted by discoveries during the year put at 423,659 barrels. It said gas reserves rose to 8.8 mln cubic feet from 8.3 mln on Dec 31, 1985, as discoveries of nearly 1.3 mln cubic feet were partialy offset by production of 287,391 cubic feet and downward revisions of previous estimates totaling 491,694 cubic feet. SAUDI SUPERTANKER REPORTED HIT BY IRAN OFF UAE Iran attacked the Saudi Arabian supertanker Arabian Sea off the United Arab Emirates last night but the vessel was able to proceed after the incident, Lloyds Shipping Intelligence reported. The 315,695-dwt Arabian Sea had set sail on Tuesday after loading oil at the Saudi port of Ras Tannurah. Lloyds said the attack occurred at about 2200 hrs local time (1800 GMT). MOST JAPAN FIRMS NOT RENEWING IRAN TERM CONTRACTS Most Japanese companies have decided not to renew term contracts to lift Iranian crude oil because spot prices remain considerably lower than OPEC\\'s official levels, industry sources said. They said a cargo of the Mideast benchmark crude Dubai traded yesterday at 16.50 dlrs a barrel, compared to its official price of 17.42 dlrs. Only one Japanese company has renewed its term contract for Iranian crude oil for the second quarter, the sources said. The sources said Japanese companies had been lifting a total of about 185,000 barrels per day (bpd) of Iranian crude under term contracts, but only one firm has agreed to lift in the second quarter. It is lifting just 10,000 to 15,000 bpd. They said this move could inspire Iran to offer discounts on cargoes loading in April, but the likelihood of discounts depended largely on the levels of spot prices. \"If the spot price of Dubai goes above 17.30 dlrs we would probably buy Iranian crude at the official price,\" one Japanese refiner said. \"We don\\'t intend to put pressure on them,\" he added. Buyers have little incentive to renew contracts to lift oil at official OPEC prices while spot prices on all grades are considerably lower, oil traders said. They said if spot prices move higher there will be no problem finding OPEC crude to purchase at the official prices. Qatar has chartered floating storage for its crude oil after finding no buyers at official prices in March. The problem is likely to recur in April, adding to that country\\'s surplus. The traders added that Iraq had dissociated itself from OPEC\\'s December production agreement, while agreeing to the fixed prices. But oil analysts said if OPEC keeps group output close to its first-half 1987 ceiling of 15.8 mln bpd, supply and demand would be balanced by the end of the second quarter. They also said if OPEC holds its official price structure based on a reference price of 18 dlrs, spot price fluctuations should be limited to a 16.50 to 17.20 dlrs range for Dubai and a 17 to 18 dlrs range for the North Sea\\'s Brent blend. One Japanese refiner said, \"At the moment there\\'s a lot of pressure on OPEC, particularly on Qatar. But if they hold out there will be no problem, and I\\'m beginning to trust their ability.\" Nigerian oil minister and OPEC president Rilwanu Lukman told a news conference in Lagos yesterday, \"Nigeria and all member countries of OPEC remain determined to uphold the December agreement by adhering strictly to their various quotas and official selling prices.\" He said OPEC believed consumers had drawn heavily on stocks of both crude oil and refined products, reducing them to levels well below this time last year. He said consumers would soon return to the market in search of crude. A Japanese refiner said, \"The European and U.S. Markets are beginning to look better so OPEC might be quite lucky.\" PHILLIPS &lt;P> TO EMPHASIZE CASH FLOW TO PARE DEBT Phillips Petroleum Co will emphasize improving its short-term cash flow this year to pare its debt, C.J. \"Pete\" Silas, chairman, told Reuters in an interview. \"Our priority is to get cash flow increased from the assets already installed,\" he said, but he declined to estimate annual cash flow for 1987. Analysts estimate Phillips\" cash flow at over one billion dlrs for 1987, while long term debt, which resulted from restructuring to find off corporate raiders in 1985, hovers about 5.9 billion dlrs as of December 1986. Silas said Phillips hope to achieve its goal by raising the capital expenditures budget to develop its oil and gas properties. \"We plan to develop the properties with short-term high cash flow prospects,\" he said. He projected a capital expenditure budget of 730 mln dlrs, up from the 1986 expenditure of 655 mln dlrs. Nearly half of that will be spent on exploration and production, and most of that will be spend overseas, Silas said. \"Phillips\\' top priority in 1987 will be to get the waterflooding in Norway and jack up the (Ekofisk) oil fields to improve our ability to extract oil and increase earnings,\" Silas said. Phillips estimates that the project, which is expected to cost 1.5 billion dlrs, will increase recovery by 170 mln gross barrels of oil over a period of 24 years. Phillips is also pursue opportunities in China where Silas said he was seeking \"a modification of terms with the Chinese government to make oil discoveries (in the offshore Xijang fields) commercially viable.\" In the U.S. Silas said Phillips hopes to get the Point Arguello, Calif., field started up by the fourth quarter. \"We expect to start up the first platform then,\" Silas said. But emphasis on short-term cash flow has also forced the company to part with several oil and gas assets. Phillips sold its interests in the T-Block in the U.K. North Sea and U.S. reserves totaling about 1.3 billion dlrs in 1986 as part of a two billion dlrs asset sales program that is now completed, Silas said. \"We sold high cost producing assets. They were not good value for us but possibly so for someone else,\" Silas said. Silas said the 1986 assets sales will not affect earnings for the company. \"Everything we are doing is to manage our cash flow and we are using that to manage our debt. Even the asset sales, while regrettable, were necessary to reduce debt,\" Silas said. He said no asset sales are planned this year as long as oil prices don\\'t fall sharply lower and stay at lower levels  for several months. \"Then, everyone would be looking at sales (of assets), and we\\'re no different from the others,\" Silas said. In other areas, Silas looks for improved earnings from Phillips chemical operations, which provided 299 mln dlrs in earnings for 1986, up from 219 mln dlrs in 1985. \"This was our second best year pushed by a good supply and demand balance for products, low feedstocks and energy costs for our operations,\" Silas said, \"In 1987 we think the market\\'s supply and demand balance will be just as good but feedstock and energy costs will rise due to price recovery.\" SAUDI OUTPUT SAID AT YEAR LOW TO HELP OPEC Saudi Arabian oil output has fallen to its lowest level in more than a year, giving fresh evidence of the kingdom\\'s determination to keep oil prices at 18 dlrs a barrel, as agreed by Opec last December, oil industry sources said. They said Saudi output in the first eight days of March averaged 2.6 mln barrels per day (bpd) including oil from the neutral zone shared with Kuwait, compared to a February average of 3.5 mln bpd. They said Saudi Arabia was also selling oil from its crude oil stocks in tankers around the world, which OPEC says must be counted towards a member\\'s production quota. Saudi Arabia\\'s quota is 4.133 mln bpd. The lower production levels indicated Saudi Arabia, the world\"s largest oil exporter, was insisting on getting Opec official prices, even at the cost of lower production, the sources said. King Fahd reiterated yesterday, in an interview with Reuters and the television news agency Visnews, the Saudi commitment to OPEC\\'s December pact to boost oil prices to an average 18 dlrs. \"Saudi Arabia is completely sticking to OPEC decisions,\" he said. The sources said the kingdom\\'s exports from Gulf ports averaged one mln bpd during the eight days ending last Sunday, down from a February average of 1.9 mln bpd. They said Saudi Arabia was allowing production to fluctuate with lifting nominations and was not trying to maintain artificially high levels by putting oil into storage. The kingdom\\'s main buyers, the four U.S. Oil firms with past stakes in the national oil company Aramco -- Mobil, Exxon, Texaco and Chevron -- enjoy considerable flexibility in the timing and volume of their liftings but are bound to pay official prices, the sources said. Spot market prices have firmed in the past two weeks but still remain below OPEC levels and major buyers have delayed liftings in the hope they would improve, the sources said. They expected low early March output to pick up towards the end of the month as buyers sought to fulfill their contractual obligations. UNION PACIFIC &lt;UNP> TO SELL PART OF REFINERY Union Pacific Corp said it will sign a pact in Caracas on March 17 with Petroleos De Venezuela, PDVSA, to sell the state owned company half of its Corpus Christi, Texas refinery owned by its Union Pacific\\'s Champlin Petroleum Co subsidiary. The sale will also include the related marketing and distribution system for the refinery\\'s products. A spokesman for the company said that a statement may be issued later today giving details of the transaction. There was no immediate comment from PDVSA officials in New York. The Corpus Christi refinery has a capacity of about 160,000 barrels per day, the Union Pacific spokesman said, and is a largely upgraded facility but he would place no value on the transaction. The additional acquisition of refinery and distribution assets by PDVSA has been expected as Venezuela has been moving aggressively to enhance its role in the oil industry from producer to excpanding its presence in the downstream sector. Purchase of part of Champlin\\'s operations also fits a profile which PDVSA officials have said previously they looked for in any acquisition. One PDVSA official said the company was looking for independent oil companies with good refinery and distribution network and a strong regional presence. The potential purchase of the interest in Champlin followed its earlier acquisition of a part interest in Southland Corp\\'s &lt;SLC> Citgo Petroleum Corp subsidiary. In that agreement signed September 15, 1986, PDVSA paid Southland 290 mln dlrs for half of Citgo\\'s stock. The potetnital acquisition of half Champlin\\'s Corpus Christi plant will also give Venezuela an additional outlet for its crude oil production while giving the refiner an assured source of supply, trade sources said. In the earlier deal with Southland, PDVSA agredd to to supply Citgo with at least 130,000 bpd of crude oil and other feedstocks. MOBIL &lt;MOB> TO RESTRUCTURE EXPLORATION UNIT Mobil Oil Corp said it will restructure its Dallas-based Mobil Exploration and Producing Services Inc operations April one, to provide stronger technological support to its U.S. and overseas operations. Mobil said the operation will consist of two new units, Technical Services and Application Technology, along with the existing Drilling and New Exploration Ventures groups. It said R.C. Mills, president and general manager of its Exploration and Producing Southeast Inc, has been named vice president and general manager of the new operation reporting to P.J. Hoenmans, president of its Exploration and Producing division. WILDLIFE UNIT PROPOSES ALASKA REFUGE OIL STUDY The National Wildlife Federation rejected an Interior Department draft plan to open wilderness lands in Northern Alaska to oil and gas exploration. The federation, the nation\\'s largest conservation group, said further study was needed to assess any possible damage that development might have on the wildlife in the area, the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Jay Hair, the federation\\'s executive vice president, called the Interior\\'s research into the effects of development \"so fundamentally flawed that it provides little or no basis on which to make a public policy decision.\" Hair called the department\\'s proposal a \"reflection of a largely political decision,\" adding \"we have no confidence in Interior to represent the broad public interest in this area.\" Interior wants to open the 1.5 million acre coastal plain to oil and gas exploration, but it said only with tough safeguards to protect the area\\'s caribou and musk-oxen. It said a preliminary survey showed the region could hold billions of barrels of oil and gas, and that its potential as an energy resource would never be known without exploration. Interior said oil on the coastal plain could match the 10 billion barrels found at Prudhoe Bay, just west of the plain. Under existing law, Congress must agree to oil and gas exploration, and if it does not act, the land will remain a wildlife refuge protected from commercial development. Hair said Interior\\'s report failed to stress the probability that finding recoverable oil is only 19 pct. He said Interior\\'s study also failed to weigh oil, gas, fish and wildlife information the State of Alaska had gathered nor had the department consulted the Environmental Protection Agency on the possible effects of exploration. The federation, in letters to Congressmen, proposed that a nine-member commission be set up to study all aspects of the issue and report back to Congress in about two years. Hair said the federation was not opposed to the possible exploration of oil, only that Interior\\'s study was inadquate to make a sound judgement. Congressional observers said that at present there was little sentiment in Congress to open the wildlife area for commercial exploitation dispite increasing concern that the United States is becoming overly dependent on foreign oil. SOLV-EX &lt;SOLV> SHELL CANADA &lt;SHC> PACT COMPLETE Solv-Ex Corp said it successfully completed its oil sands pilot testing program under its agreement with Shell Canada Limited &lt;SHC> and received a 250,000 U.S. dlr bonus payment. It also said that Shell Canada exercised its option to take over Solv-Ex\\'s 25 pct working interest in the construction of the oil facility, relieving it of its obligation to raise about 62.5 mln Canadian dlrs for plant construction. It said 30 pct of that loan was guaranteed by the Government of Alberta. In exchange for Shell\\'s participation, Solv-Ex said Shell is obligated to pay it an up-front royalty and a running royalty based on the operating profits of the oil sands facility. It said the Shell Canada 7,500 barrel per day oil sands project will be built on Shell\\'s oil sand lease about 40 miles north of Fort McMurray in the Athabasca region of northern Alberta. Solv-Ex said the project will cost about 260 mln Canadian dlrs. It said that following a final feasibility study the plant should open in the early 1990s when oil prices are expected to exceed 20 U.S. dlrs per barrel. UNION PACIFIC &lt;UNP> IN PARTNERSHIP WITH PDVSA Union Pacific Corp said it will enter a 50-50 partnership with Petroles de Venezuela, PDVSA, to own and operate Union Pacific\\'s 160,000 barrel-per-day Corpus Christi, Texas, oil refinery. The assests to be acquired by the partnership are valued at 190 mln dlrs, Union Pacific said. Closing is expected to take place in early April and the venture is to be called Champlin Refining Co. The partnership will acquire the refining and distribution systems currently owned and operated by Champlin Petroleum, a wholly owned subsidiary of Union Pacific. The venture will acquire the related inventories and the Champlin trade name, the company said. PDVSA and Union Pacific will each contribute half the capital required by the venture and arrange a revolving credit facility with U.S. and foreign banks to finance inventories and receivables, Union Pacific said. Petroles de Venezuela also signed a 25-year agreement to supply at least 140,000 bpd of Venezulean crude oil and naphtha to the refinery at market related prices. Under various options the in the agreement PDVSA could supply another 50,000 bpd on similar terms, the company said. \"This will provide a stable, long-term supply to the refinery at competitive costs, thereby assuring the economic viability of the plant,\" a statement issued by Union Pacific said. The statement said the agreement with PDVSA will enable the company to supply a steady flow of refined products to its customers. Union Pacific said employees of the refinery would be transfered to the new company and would retain the same benefits as in the past. POWERINE REFINERY TO RESUME OPERATIONS &lt;Powerine Oil Co> said its refinery here will resume operation today, with initial crude oil runs of 20,000 barrels per day. Powerine, a privately-held company, said it expects the refinery to become fully operational by May, with crude oil throughput at 35,000 bpd. Initial oil products deliveries are scheduled for Monday, Powerine said. The refinery had been closed due to a change of ownership, the company said. MONTEDISON, OTHER REFINERIES TO SHUT FOR WORK Selm-Societa Energia Montedison is to close its Priolo crude refining units from March 15th to March 28th for maintenance, a company spokesman said. Throughput at the refinery is currently estimated at 140-150,000 bpd, although total capacity is nearer 200,000 bpd. Several other Mediterranean refineries are currently shutdown for maintenance, most of which were scheduled some months ago. But industry sources said that shutdowns may have been rearranged to avoid running negative-netback crude. Tighter availabilities of products as a result of the shutdowns in the Med is helping to keep products markets bullish, particularly for March deliveries, oil traders said. Garrone\\'s refinery at San Quirico (capacity 130,000 bpd) is due to shutdown on March 14th for three weeks, and the jointly-owned ISAB/Garrone refinery at Mellili, capacity 220,000 bpd, is due to start up around March 20-25th following its closure for maintenance a month ago, a company spokesman said. The Esso Italiana refineries at Augusta and Siracusa will not be closing this spring, a spokesman for the company said. In France, the distillation unit at Societe Francaise de BP\\'s Lavera refinery has been closed for maintenance since March 2, and is due to restart early April. Total capacity is 181,900 bpd. It is currently operating at around 50 pct capacity, a company spokesman said. Shell Francaise\\'s Berre l\\'Etang refinery will shut down in early April until mid-June, a company spokesman said. Capacity is around 150,000 bpd. Compagnie Francaise de Raffinage (CFR) will close the visbreaker at its La Mede refinery in early April, but would not affect crude throughput at the refinery, a company spokesman said. Current capacity is 136,000 bbl/day. Despite current bullish sentiment in the Med, however, traders noted that crude netbacks are beginning to look more attractive, and most maintenance shutdowns should be finished in two to three weeks. As a result, oil industry sources suggest that the situation may ease by mid-April. ATTACKS AFFECT COLOMBIA\\'S OIL OUTLOOK-ECOPETROL Continuous rebel raids against oil pipelines and foreign exploration camps endanger Colombia\\'s present oil bonanza, Franciso Chona, manager of the state-run oil company Ecopetrol said. \"It seems the subversion wants to end with our oil bonanza,\" he told reporters. He was speaking after a meeting with Defense Minister Rafael Samudio, military chiefs and Mines and Energy Minister Guillermo Perry to review the security situation in the light of a recent upsurge of leftist guerrilla attacks in the oil-rich Arauca region, bordering Venezuela. Ecopetrol chief of security, Retired General Carlos Narvaez, said security measures would be stricter and that the armed forces were closely collaborating but gave no details. Samudio said new plans had been designed and hoped they would be effective. Samudio stressed that, despite the most recent attacks, which cost more than four mln dlrs in damage, the overall situation had improved compared with last December when initial measures were taken to combat a wave of attacks. Repeated bombings of a vital pipeline from the Cano Limon oilfield to the Caribbean then led to a loss of 51,000 barrels of crude. 12-MAR-1987 12-MAR-1987 SUN &lt;SUN> RAISES CRUDE POSTINGS 50 CTS Sun Co said it raised the contract price it will pay for crude oil 50 cts a barrel, effective today. The increase brings Sun\\'s posted price for the West Texas Intermediate and West Texas Sour grades to 17.50 dlrs/bbl. The Light Louisiana Sweet grade was also raised 50 cts to 17.85 dlrs/bbl. Sun Co last changed its crude postings on March 4. DIAMOND SHAMROCK RAISED CRUDE BY 50 CTS/BBL TODAY. WTI UP TO 17.50 DLRS. DIAMOND SHAMROCK RAISED CRUDE BY 50 CTS/BBL TODAY. WTI UP TO 17.50 DLRS.

The February total represented a 49 pct decrease from February 1986. Worldwide, the association\\'s monthly survey showed that seismic exploration for oil and gas increased to 395 in February, up three from the month before. Africa added three seismic crews, the Middle East increased by two and the Far East added one while reductions were reported in Central and South America, Europe and the United States. PHILLIPS &lt;P> RAISES CRUDE POSTINGS 50 CTS Phillips Petroleum said it raised the contract price it will for all grades of crude oil 50 cts a barrel, effective today. The increase brings Phillip\\'s posted price for the West Texas Intermediate and West Texas Sour grades to 17.50 dlrs a bbl. Phillips last changed its crude oil postings on March 4. The price increase follows similar moves by USX\\'s &lt;X> subsidiary, Marathon oil, and Sun Co &lt;SUN> earlier today. DIAMOND SHAMROCK &lt;DIA> RAISES CRUDE POSTINGS Diamond Shamrock said it raised the contract price it will pay for crude oil 50 cts a barrel, effective today. The increase brings the company\\'s posted price for the benchmark grade, West Texas Intermediate, to 17.50 dlrs/bbl. Diamond Shamrock last changed its postings on March 4. HOUSE SPEAKER BACKS OIL IMPORT FORECAST PLAN House Speaker Jim Wright endorsed a proposal to require the president to take action to reduce oil imports if they threaten to top 50 pct of U.S. consumption. Wright told reporters the plan by Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, a fellow Texas Democrat, was positive and useful. Oil imports peaked in 1977 at 47 pct, were short of 36 pct last year and this year are up over 40 pct, Bentsen said. The Bentsen proposal, supported by 24 other Senators, would would require the president to issue annual three-year oil import forecasts. In any year they threatened to top 50 pct, he would be ordered to propose quotas or other solution. UNOCAL RAISES MOST CRUDE PRICES 50 CTS, TODAY, WTI AT 17.50 DLRS UNOCAL RAISES MOST CRUDE PRICES 50 CTS, TODAY, WTI AT 17.50 DLRS PERMIAN BASIN &lt;PBT> PROVEN RESERVES FALL Permian Basin Royalty Trust said that as of December 31, 1986, its estimated proved reserves totaled 18.5 mln barrels of oil and 52.9 mln MCF, or thousand cubic feet, of gas. This compares with yearend 1985 proved reserves estimates of 26.4 mln barrels of oil and 78.6 mln MCF of gas, Permian said. Permian said December 1986 future net revenues from proved reserves were 335.6 mln dlrs, down from 814.2 mln dlrs in 1985. Permian said the present value of estimated future net revenues discounted at 10 pct is 165.3 mln dlrs, compared with 374.3 mln dlrs. It said the downward revisions in both proved reserves and estimated future net revenues resulted from decreased prices for oil and gas. UNOCAL &lt;UCL> RAISES CRUDE OIL POSTINGS Unocal Corp said it raised the contract price it will pay for most grades of crude oil 50 cts a barrel, effective today. The increase brings Unocal\\'s posted price for the U.S. benchmark grade West Texas Intermediate to 17.50 dlrs a barrel. It also brought the price for West Texas Sour to 17.50 dlrs a bbl. Light Louisiana Sweet was also raised 50 cts to 17.85 dlrs/bbl. Unocal last changed its crude postings on March four, and brings it price in line with other major companies, which have been raising prices steadily in recent weeks. The increase also represents the latest in a series of increases that began with USX Corp\\'s &lt;X> Marathon Petroleum Corp\\'s notification yesterday evening that, effective today, it raised its crude postings 50 cts a barrel, bringing its contract price for WTI to 17.50 dlrs a barrel. Earlier today, Sun Co &lt;SUN>, Phillips Petroleum &lt;P> and Diamond Shamrock &lt;DIA> also said they raised their crude postings 50 cts a barrel, bringing their WTI contract price to 17.50 dlrs a barrel. Contract prices have risen in response to higher spot market prices, oil traders said.

In the year-ago period, it said proved reserves were estimated at 346.4 thousand cubic feet of gas  and 1,974,000 barrels of oil. It said the present value of future net revenues discounted 10 pct was 156.2 mln dlrs compared with 446.8 mln dlrs in the year-ago period. It also said that about 60 net infill wells are not economical to drill at December 31 prices. BRAZIL CANCELS OIL PURCHASE FROM SAUDI ARABIA Brazil\\'s state-oil company, Petrobras, cancelled a 40 mln dlr crude oil purchase from Saudi Arabia after the Saudis refused to accept credit guarantees from the Bank of Brazil, a Petrobras official said. Export director Carlos Santana told a press conference the Saudis were the first suppliers of oil to impose such conditions after Brazil\\'s decision to halt interest payment of its commercial debts last month. The shipment of 2.2 mln barrels represents two days of oil consumption in Brazil. But Santana said if the Saudis change their minds and decide to respect the terms of the contract, then Petrobras will lift the order to cancel the shipment. Santana said if the Saudis do not accept Brazil\\'s terms by Monday then Petrobras will negotiate elsewhere. \"Petrobras has been Saudi Arabia\\'s traditional client since 1955. If they do not accept our conditions now, it will be much better for us, because with the market prices more or less the same, buying from Iraq and China is an advantage,\" he said. Iraq and China have barter deals with Brazil, importing Brazilian goods in exchange for oil, but the Saudis buy nothing from Brazil, he said. Santana said despite a strike threat by oil industry workers and a two-week stoppage by Brazilian seamen, Petrobras oil stocks are \"reasonably balanced.\" Saudi Arabia is Brazil\\'s second biggest oil supplier, with an average 115,000 bpd. Iraq is the main supplier with 235,000 bpd. China comes third, with 58,000 bpd. \"If the Saudis wish to stop our trade relationship, fine, I am sure that if they do, we will be getting dozens of offers from elsewhere,\" Santana added. INDIA GETS 140 MLN DLR WORLD BANK LOAN The World Bank said it has approved a 140 mln dlr loan for India to help lessen that country\\'s dependence on imported oil and spur development of its own petroleum resources. The bank said the loan will be used to boost production by injecting gas in the partially depleted Assam oil fields and to assist exploration in other areas, including drilling 10 exploratory wells. The bank said the recipient of the 20-year loan will be Oil India Ltd (OIL), which is the smaller of two public Indian petroleum exploration and production companies.

VENEZUELA TO LEND ECUADOR 50,000 BPD OF CRUDE Venezuela will lend Ecuador 50,000 barrels per day of crude oil over the next few months to help it meet its export commitments, Energy and Mines Minister Arturo Hernandez Grisanti said today. He said that under the terms of this loan, agreed during a visit here this week by Ecuador\\'s Deputy Energy Minister Fernando Santos Alvite, Ecuador will begin repaying the loan in August. Hernandez Grisanti said the loan will go part way to offsetting the loss of Ecuador\\'s 140,000 in exports caused by earthquake damage to 25 miles of pipeline last week. Ecuador was forced to suspend exports after the pipeline connecting its jungle oil fields with the pacific port of Balao was put out of action. Venezuela has an output quota of 1.495 bpd, while Ecuador\\'s is 210,000 bpd. Santos Alvite said Ecuador will ask OPEC to allow it to produce 100,000 bpd above its quota when the pipeline is repaired to offset present production losses. Hernandez Grisanti said also a first 300,000 barrels shipment of Venezuelan crude oil will leave for Ecuador this weekend to help meet domestic consumption needs. The oil, part of a five mln additional crude oil loan by Venezuela, will be processed at Guayaquil refineries. \"If we had not supplied oil to Ecuador the life of this country would have ground to a halt,\" he said. Opec deliberately under 15.8 mln barrel ceiling to defend price - Subroto Opec deliberately under 15.8 mln barrel ceiling to defend price - Subroto SUBROTO SEES OIL MARKET CONTINUING BULLISH Indonesian Energy Minister Subroto said he sees the oil market continuing bullish, with underlying demand expected to rise later in the year. He told a press conference in Jakarta at the end of a two-day meeting of South-East Asian Energy Ministers that he saw prices stabilizing around 18 dlrs a barrel. \"The sentiment in the market is bullish and I think it will continue that way as demand will go up in the third or fourth quarters,\" Subroto said. Asked about the prospect for oil prices, he said: \"I think they will stabilise around 18 dlrs, although there is a little turbulence ...\" \"Of course the spot price will fluctuate, but the official price will remain at 18 dlrs,\" he added. OPEC DEFENDING 18 DLR PRICE, SUBROTO SAYS Indonesian Energy Minister Subroto said OPEC is deliberately under its production ceiling of 15.8 mln barrels to defend its 18 dlr a barrel price target. He told reporters at an energy conference in Jakarta that OPEC had decided to maintain its price level of 18 dlrs. \"We are deliberately defending the price, so OPEC production is less than 15.8 (mln) at the moment,\" he stated. Asked if OPEC would increase production if prices went above 18 dlrs a barrel, he said this would be decided at the next OPEC meeting in June. \"We will discuss the market situation then,\" he added. He said a meeting of the OPEC Differentials Committee had been postponed because \"there is no need for the meeting.\" He did not elaborate. The committee had originally been due to meet in Vienna this week. PETROBRAS CANCELS OIL PURCHASE FROM SAUDI ARABIA Brazil\\'s state oil company Petrobras has cancelled a 40 mln dlr crude oil purchase from Saudi Arabia after the Saudis refused to accept credit guarantees from the Bank of Brazil and did not disclose reasons, a Petrobras official said. Export director Carlos Santana told reporters the Saudis were the first suppliers of oil to impose such conditions after Brazil\\'s decision to halt interest payment of its commercial debts last month. The shipment of 2.2 mln barrels represents two days of consumption. He said the Saudis reported they would no longer accept letters of credit from the Bank of Brazil or even from Saudi banks and that Brazil would have to obtain credit guarantees from leading international banks. In February, Brazil had contracted to buy 125,000 bpd from the Saudis until June. Saudi Arabia is Brazil\\'s second biggest oil supplier, with an average 115,000 bpd. Iraq is the main supplier with 235,000 bpd. China comes third, with 58,000 bpd. \"If the Saudis wish to stop our trade relationship...I am sure that if they do, we will be getting dozens of offers from elsewhere,\" Santana added. Santana said if the Saudis change their minds and decide to respect the terms of the contract, then Petrobras will lift the order to cancel the shipment. The Saudis had put similar conditions on a previous shipment, he added. \"We telexed them saying that if they insisted, we would rather cancel the contract and buy the product elsewhere,\" Santana said. After Petrobras threatened to cancel the contract, the Saudis changed their minds and decided to accept the Bank of Brazil\\'s credit guarantees, he said. SUBROTO SEES OIL MARKET CONTINUING BULLISH Indonesian Energy Minister Subroto said he sees the oil market continuing bullish, with underlying demand expected to rise later in the year.

WEATHER CLOSES ALEXANDRIA PORT, SUMED OIL TERMINAL Strong winds and high seas forced the closure of Egypt\\'s main port of Alexandria and a nearby oil terminal, port officials said. Tanker loading at the Suez-Mediterranean Arab Petroleum Pipelines Co in Sedi Kerir, southwest of here, stopped and officials said five tankers were at anchorage awaiting improved weather. SHELL CANADA RAISES CRUDE PRICES BY 64 CANADIAN CTS/BBL TODAY AT EDMONTON SHELL CANADA RAISES CRUDE PRICES BY 64 CANADIAN CTS/BBL TODAY AT EDMONTON ORS SEEKS CANADIAN FUNDS FOR HEAVY OIL TEST &lt;ORS Corp> said &lt;Dominion Securities (Alberta) Inc> has been appointed to offer common shares in a new Canadaina company being organized to exploit heavy oil production opportunities in Canada and Western Europe. ORS said the offer for private sale of the stock being made on a best efforts basis is designed to raise five mln Canadian dlrs which the new company will invest in properties and projects using the Electromagnetic Well Stimulation Process developed by IIT Research Institute under sponsorship of ORS. PETROBRAS ASKS ARMY TO WITHDRAW TROOPS Brazil\\'s state-oil company Petrobras has asked the Army to withdraw the troops which were occupying its oil installations since Tuesday, Petrobras said in a statement. The statement said the request for the withdrawal of the troops was made because of the calmness reigning in all of its refineries. \"The request was also due to the end of the seamen\\'s strike and the willingness of the oil industry workers to sit again by the negotiating table,\" the statement said. Even though the Petrobras statement said the seamen\\'s strike was over, a union spokesman said only two small shipping companies had reached a pay agreement. The overwhelming majority of Brazil\\'s seamen remained on strike. The statement said a meeting between Petrobras and oil industry leaders was set for next Wednesday in Rio, with the presence of Labour Minister Almir Pazzionotto as a mediator. Petrobras said the request for the withdrawal of the troops was made at 1100 local hours (1400 GMT), but a company spokesman said he did not know if the troops had already been removed. STUDY GROUP URGES INCREASED U.S. OIL RESERVES A study group said the United States should increase its strategic petroleum reserve to one mln barrels as one way to deal with the present and future impact of low oil prices on the domestic oil industry. U.S. policy now is to raise the strategic reserve to 750 mln barrels, from its present 500 mln, to help protect the economy from an overseas embargo or a sharp price rise. The Aspen Institute for Humanistic Studies, a private group, also called for new research for oil exploration and development techniques. It predicted prices would remain at about 15-18 dlrs a barrel for several years and then rise to the mid 20s, with imports at about 30 pct of U.S. consumption. It said instead that such moves as increasing oil reserves and more exploration and development research would help to guard against or mitigate the risks of increased imports. MOBIL &lt;MOB> CAPITAL EXPENDITURES LOWER IN 1987 Mobil Corp chairman Allen E. Murray said in the annual report issued today that the company\\'s total 1987 capital expenditures would be lower than the three billion dlrs spent in 1986. \"Overall capital and exploration expenditures will fall slightly below the level for 1986 although we\\'ll be ready to increase spending whenever the outlook becomes more promising,\" Murray said. Mobil data in the annual report shows capital expenditures have been cut every year since 1984\\'s 3.6 billion dlrs to 3.5 billion dlrs in 1985. Murray told shareholders that despite the cuts \"the company has promising acreage to explore as well as major oil and gas reserves to develop in the U.S., Canada, Europe, Africa and Indonesia. Over the past two weeks Mobil has announced restructuring of its domestic exploration and development organization and this week a restructuring of its oil services units, which support the new affiliate. \"Mobil\\'s chairman has explained this change by saying we need a leaner organization to get more efficient usage from our assets,\" said John Lord, a Mobil Corp spokesman. Murray said in announcing the first reorganization, which will combine its current three exploration and producing affiliates into one organization, Mobil Exploration and Production U.S. Inc, that it is more effective than the present organization and will improve the company\\'s upstream competitive position. Yesterday the company said that it will restructure its Mobil Exploration and Producing Services Inc, MEPSI, to enhance the development and transfer of technology supporting critical areas of exploration, drilling, resevoir management and computer systems. Earnings from Mobil\\'s upstream operations in 1986 were 827 mln dlrs, down 54 pct from the previous year\\'s 1.8 billion dlrs in earnings. Mobil\\'s strategy in the exploration and production sector will be to give most attention to exploration possibilities with the greatest long term potential, the company said. In its annual report, Mobil said that this will include greater emphasis on \"frontier plays that, although riskier, fit our strengths of technology and size...This probably also means a shift toward emphasis in the foreign area since selective overseas exploration offers greater potential.\" BRAZILIAN TROOPS TO LEAVE OIL REFINERIES Brazil\\'s labour troubles eased a little today as the authorities announced they were withdrawing troops from the country\\'s main oil installations occupied three days ago. The troops went in at the request of the state-oil company Petrobras because of the threat of a strike by 55,000 oil industry employees. Petrobras said in a statement today it had requested the withdrawal of the troops. The situation in the refineries was calm, it said, and the employees had indicated their willingness to negotiate a pay deal. A national seamen\\'s strike, however, continued and marines remained in the country\\'s main ports. The marines were despatched to the ports after the seamen\\'s strike, now two weeks old, was ruled illegal last Friday. A spokesman at the national strike headquarters in Rio de Janeiro said today a total of l63 ships were strike-bound, 135 in Brazil and 28 in foreign ports. Yesterday two small companies specialised in the transport of chemicals, Global and Flumar, struck a pay accord with their seamen who have secured a 120 pct increase. Brazilian newspapers today hailed these agreements as a sign that the national strike could soon come to an end. Both companies employ fewer than 200 seamen and union leaders said the vast majority of Brazil\\'s 40,000 seamen were still on strike. The threat of a stoppage by oil industry employees appeared today to be receding. Petrobras said in its statement that the company would meet union leaders for pay talks in Rio de Janeiro next Wednesday. Labour Minister Almir Pazzionotto would act as a mediator. Besides industrial troubles, there has also been considerable unrest this week in the agricultural sector. On Tuesday hundreds of thousands of farmers held rallies throughout the country to protest against high interest rates. Television reports showed some of these protests still continuing today, with farmers blockading banks with their vehicles in several towns in the states of Sao Paulo and Parana. The strikes in Brazil come as the government is trying to extricate itself from a serious debt crisis brought on by a deterioration in its trade balance. On February 20 President Jose Sarney announced that Brazil was suspending interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of debt to private banks. Because of the seamen strike exports are being delayed and the country is losing badly needed foreign exchange. MOBIL &lt;MOB> ADDS NATURAL GAS RESERVES IN 1986 Mobil Corp increased net proven reserves of natural gas liquids in 1986 from the previous year according to data in its 1986 annual report. The report states that total net proved reserves at year\\'s end stood at 2.5 billion barrels, an increase of 94 mln barrels or four pct above the previous year and detailed data show that the gains resulted from an increase in net proved reserves of natural gas liquids. Mobil said gains were in Indonesia where a sixth production facility began operation in October with a capacity to manufacture 1.7 mln tonnes of liquified natural gas. The company also said that new capacity brought onstream last year replaced 120 pct of Mobil\\'s production, which declined by about four pct in 1986 from the previous year. Detailed data on reserves shows that U.S. net proved reserves of crude oil fell to 837 mln barrels from 853 mln barrels in 1985, natural gas liquid reserves were also lower in 1986 from the previous year. Net proved crude oil reserves also fell in Canada to 224 mln barrels and in Europe to 403 mln barrels from the previous year\\'s level of 231 mln barrels and 439 mln barrels, respectively. ECUADOR BEGINS WORK ON OIL PIPELINE TO COLOMBIA Construction workers today began building a 26 km (16 mile) pipeline to link Ecuador\\'s jungle oilfields to a pipeline in Colombia through which Ecuadorean crude could be pumped to the Pacific Coast, Ecuadorean energy minsitry officials said. They said it would take about two months and at least 15 mln dlrs to build the pipeline from Lago Agrio in Ecuador to Puerto Colon, Colombia for connection to the Colombian pipeline, which goes to the port of Tumaco on Colombia\\'s Pacific Ocean coast. The Lago Agrio to Puerto Colon pipeline is designed to transport between 30,000 to 50,000 barrels of day (bpd) of Ecuadorean crude to the Colombian pipeline, they said. The Colombian pipeline to Tumaco has ample room for Ecuadorean crude, they said. It is currently transporting about 17,000 bpd out of its 100,000 bpd capacity, an Ecuadorean energy ministry official said. The Ecuadorean crude reaching Tumaco will be shipped by boat to Ecuador for refining into oil products to meet domestic demand. The completion of the pipeline would allow Ecuador to resume some of production, paralysed since March six by an earthquake the night before. The tremor ruptured the country\\'s main pipeline from jungle oilfields to the Ecuadorean port of Balao, on the Pacific Ocean. Ecuador was pumping about 260,000 bpd before the earthquake. It would take about five months to repair the pipeline to Balao, government officials said. Ecuador estimates that it will cost between 145 to 150 mln dlrs to repair oil installations damaged by the earthquake, energy ministry Javier Espinosa said.

It predicted prices would remain at about 15-18 dlrs a barrel for several years and then rise to the mid 20s, with imports at about 30 pct of U.S. consumption. The study cited two basic policy paths for the nation: to protect the U.S. industry through an import fee or other such device or to accept the full economic benefits of cheap oil. But the group did not strongly back either option, saying there were benefits and drawbacks to both. It said instead that such moves as increasing oil reserves and more exploration and development research would help to guard against or mitigate the risks of increased imports.

PETRO-CANADA CUT CRUDE PRICES BY 1.43 CANADIAN DLRS/BBL EFFECTIVE MARCH ONE PETRO-CANADA CUT CRUDE PRICES BY 1.43 CANADIAN DLRS/BBL EFFECTIVE MARCH ONE PDVSA TO SIGN CHAMPLIN REFINERY DEAL MARCH 17 Petroleos de Venezuela, S.A. said it will sign a contract March 17 to buy a half interest in a Corpus Christi, Texas refinery and related operations. The contract, to be signed by PDVSA and Champlin Petroleum\\'s parent company, the Union Pacific Corp, will create a new joint venture called Champlin Refining. The state oil company said PDVSA will pay on the order of 30 mln dlrs for the half interest in Champlin. Energy minister Arturo Hernandez Grisanti said Wednesday the cost would be 33 mln dlrs in cash, plus an additional 60 mln in crude and refined oil shipments. PDVSA and Union Pacific have sought a line of credit from a group of North American and Japanese banks to finance the new company\\'s working capital, the Venezuelan company said. Under the deal, PDVSA will supply up to 140,000 barrels a day to the refinery with the option to place 50,000 bpd more - mostly gasoline and distillates - through Champlin\\'s distribution system in 10 U.S. states. The new company will be directed by a six-member board, with three representatives each from PDVSA and Union Pacific. According to PDVSA, Venezuelans will occupy such key positions such as treasurer and vice-president for manufacturing. The total capacity of the Champlin refinery is 160,000 bpd of crudes and another 40,000 bpd of intermediates. The plant will be able to handle 110,000 bpd of Venezuelan heavy crudes, which make up more than half of the country\\'s crude oil exports. VENEZUELA TO LEND UP TO 12.5 MLN BARRELS OF OIL Venezuela will lend Ecuador up to 12.5 mln barrels of crude oil to help it meet its export commitments and its domestic energy demand, Ecuadorean Energy and Mines Minister Javier Espinosa said today in a statement. Ecuador was forced to suspend exports after the pipeline connecting its jungle oil fields with the Pacific Ocean port of Balao was damaged last week by an earthquake. Venezuela would lend 50,000 barrels per day of crude for a total of up to to 7.5 mln barrels to help Ecuador meet export commitments, Espinosa said. Also, Venezuela will sell the crude and provide the foreign exchange earnings to Ecuador, he said. Ecuador would repay Venezuela in crude once it resumed its exports after repairing its pipeline to Balao, a task that would take an estimated five  months. Venezuela is lending Ecuador five mln barrels of crude for refining in this country to meet domestic demand. Ecuador would repay that loan with crude once the oil pipeline is repaired. Both countries are the only Latin American members of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). Ecuador was exporting about 140,000 bpd before the earthquake, Energy Ministry officials said. Its total output was around 260,000 bpd. PDVSA TO SIGN CHAMPLIN REFINERY DEAL MARCH 17 Petroleos de Venezuela, S.A. said it will sign a contract March 17 to buy a half interest in a Corpus Christi, Texas refinery and related operations.

SAUDIS DROP CONDITION FOR OIL SALE TO BRAZIL Saudi Arabia has dropped its condition that Brazil secure international bank guarantees before Saudia Arabia would ship it oil, the state-oil company, Petrobras, said in a statement. Petrobras said the Saudis will accept Banco do Brasil credit guarantees. Petrobras cancelled a 40-mln dlr crude oil purchase from the Saudis yesterday after they refused to accept a letter of credit from the official Bank of Brazil. The Saudis had demanded that Brazil get credit guarantees from leading international banks. Petrobras said the Saudis had been advised that if they did not change their mind by Monday, Petrobras would negotiate the purchase of oil with other producers. The Petrobras statement said the shipment of 2.2 mln barrels will be made by the Saudis on March 24 as scheduled. The shipment is part contract signed in February for the Saudis to supply Brazil with 125,000 barrels per day until June. SAUDI ARABIA DECIDES TO ACCEPT BRAZIL CREDIT Saudi Arabia has lifted the condition it imposed on the sale of oil to Brazil and will accept Banco do Brasil\\'s credit guarantees, state-oil company Petrobras said in a statement. Petrobras cancelled a 40 mln dlr crude oil purchase from the Saudis yesterday, after they refused to accept a letter of credit from the Bank of Brazil, demanding guarantees from leading international banks. It advised the Saudis the company would negotiate oil purchases elsewhere unless they changed their mind by Monday. The 2.2 mln barrels shipment will be made by the Saudis on March 24 as scheduled, the statement said. Under a 125,000 bpd contract signed in February the Saudis agreed to supply oil to Brazil until June. YUGOSLAVIAN OIL FIRM STARTS WORKING WITH FRENCH Yugoslavia\\'s top oil and natural gas producer &lt;Ina-Naftaplin> has started to implement a cooperation contract signed last year with the French petrochemical concern &lt;Petro Chemie>, the official Tanjug news agency said. Under the deal Petro Chemie supplies oil to Ina refineries in Sisak and Rijeka and ships parts to 12 Yugoslav firms in the petrochemical, chemical, textile and plastics industries. The Yugoslav firms, in turn, will export oil products to France. Tanjug said this year\\'s exchange will value 530 mln dlrs. Ina signed a similar deal with West Germany\\'s Hoechst AG &lt;HFAG.F> two years ago. Ina also has joint ventures and co-production projects, involving Yugoslavia\\'s other main producer &lt;Naftagas> of Novi Sad, with partners in Angola, Algeria and Tunisia, exploring for and exploiting oil and natural gas. An estimated 300,000 tonnes of oil will thus be obtained from fields in Angola over the next 15 years, Tanjug said. Ina accounts for some 75 pct of Yugoslavia\\'s total oil production, which amounts to 4.2 mln tonnes a year. Ina earned more than 154 mln dlrs from exports of goods and services to 39 countries last year and ranks among Yugoslavia\\'s leading export enterprises. In a separate statement issued through Tanjug, Ina said it has successfully completed the first drill at the depth of over 3,000 meters in the Bay of Baes, in Tunisia. Ina is jointly prospecting with the U.S. Firm Conoco for oil and gas there. Work on a second drill, below 4,000 meters, would start soon in the Bay of Gabes, the statement said. Ina would invest about 8.5 mln dlrs in prospecting in the Gabes area. Conoco, which has completed geological prospecting for the Tunisian government, has transferred one third of its option rights in the region to Ina, it said. BRAZILIAN BANK WORKERS DECIDE ON NATIONAL STRIKE Brazilian bank workers voted to launch a nationwide strike this month, compounding labour unrest arising from the failure of the government\\'s anti-inflation plan. At a rally in this city, about 100 km northwest of Sao Paulo, about 5,000 bank workers voted to strike on March 24 unless their demand for 100 pct pay rises is met. Wilson Gomes de Moura, president of the national confederation which groups the bank employees\\' 152 unions representing 700,000 workers, told Reuters the indefinite stoppage would affect all banks. The vote came as a stoppage by seamen entered its third week and as 55,000 oil workers threatened action against the state-owned petroleum company Petrobras. The government ordered thousands of troops into the refineries on Tuesday to forestall any occupation, but the troops were removed yesterday. Petrobras said it had requested their withdrawal because the refineries were calm and oil workers had indicated their willingess to negotiate next Wednesday. The government has also sent marines into the main ports. A spokesman at strike headquarters for the seamen in Rio de Janeiro said unions were studying an offer by private shipowners for a 120 pct pay rise. Seamen employed by two small companies have already accepted a 120 pct pay rise and returned to work, as have about 5,000 seamen employed by Petrobras. Last week also saw widespread protests by hundreds of thousands of farmers over what they see as unfairly high interest rates charged by banks. According to official estimates, prices rose by more than 33 pct in the first two months of this year. SAUDI OIL MINISTER FORESEES NO NEED FOR NEW OPEC MEASURES BEFORE JUNE 25 SAUDI OIL MINISTER FORESEES NO NEED FOR NEW OPEC MEASURES BEFORE JUNE 25 SAUDI OIL MINISTER SEES NO NEED TO ALTER OPEC PACT Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Hisham Nazer said OPEC\\'s December agreement to stabilise oil prices at 18 dlrs a barrel was being implemented satisfactorily and there was no immediate need to change it. Nazer, in an interview with Reuters and the television news agency Visnews, said Saudi Arabia was producing around three mln barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil, well below its OPEC quota. Saudi Arabia, the world\\'s largest oil exporter, will continue to restrain production as long as other OPEC members adhere to the pact, Nazer said. The 13-nation OPEC agreed in December to cut its production ceiling by 7.25 pct to 15.8 mln bpd and abide by fixed prices averaging 18 dlrs a barrel from February 1. Nazer, in his first interview since succeeding Ahmed Zaki Yamani last October, said: \"I do not foresee any need for new measures before the 25th of June when our (next OPEC) meeting will take place as scheduled.\" Nazer said OPEC was producing below 15.8 mln bpd and all members were abiding by its agreements. \"We\\'ve heard news every now and then of violations but they were not at all verified,\" he said. OPEC production curbs have boosted world oil prices from a 13-year low of around eight dlrs a barrel last August to near 18 dlrs after announcement of the December pact. Spot market prices slipped some two dlrs in February but have firmed in the past two weeks to near OPEC levels as traders gained confidence in OPEC price and output discipline. Nazer said Saudi Arabia would continue to produce below its 4.133 mln bpd quota if necessary to defend the 18 dlr price. \"As long as all the OPEC members adhere to the program as devised in December, Saudi Arabia will continue to adhere to the agreement,\" he said. Current production of three mln bpd includes oil from the Neutral Zone shared with Kuwait, but not sales from floating storage, Nazer said. King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, in an interview with Reuters and Visnews on March 11, said the kingdom wanted oil price stability and called on non-OPEC producers to avoid harmful competition with OPEC. \"Saudi Arabia doesn\\'t decide prices by itself but certainly desires price stability,\" he said. Nazer said the output level did not mean the kingdom had returned to a role of \"swing producer\" within OPEC. Saudi Arabia allowed its output to sink as low as two mln bpd in August 1985 to compensate for slack demand and over-production by some OPEC states. \"Saudi Arabia is not playing that role. It is being played by OPEC membership as a whole because the reduction in the 15.8 mln bpd share of OPEC in the market is being shared by other members of OPEC,\" Nazer said. Nazer said OPEC estimated demand for its oil during third quarter this year would be around 16.6 mln bpd. But he said if circumstances changed \"I am sure then the OPEC members will consult with each other and take the necessary measures.\" Oil analysts say the OPEC pact could come under strain when demand for petroleum products generally falls in the northern hemisphere spring and summer. Nazer said he was satisfied with the extent of cooperation from non-OPEC producers. Norway, Egypt and the Soviet Union agreed to help OPEC by restraining production or exports after he visited them on OPEC\\'s behalf earlier this year. \"We did not ask any country to do anything. These were programmes they thought were necessary to stabilise market conditions and to help themselves attain better pricing conditions,\" Nazer said. He said it was up to countries that declined to cooperate -- such as Britain -- to come up with their own proposals if they saw fit. SAUDI BUSINESSMEN TO DISCUSS PRIVATE SECTOR Saudi Arabian business leaders assembled for a conference aimed at thrashing out problems facing the private sector of the kingdom\\'s oil-dependent economy. The meeting of some 500 top businessmen from across Saudi Arabia comes at a time of guarded optimism in industry and commerce following the OPEC pact to boost world oil prices. The four-day conference in this resort town, high in the mountains above the Tihamah plain stretching to the Red Sea, has been organised by Saudi Arabia\\'s chambers of commerce. Finance Minister Mohammed Ali Abal-Khail and Commerce Minister Suleiman Abdulaziz al-Salim will attend the first day. Bankers and businessmen said the conference will air problems facing commerce and industry after last year\\'s slide in oil prices and examine ways to promote higher investment in a private sector sorely short of finance. Government planners have long recognised that Saudi Arabia, the world\\'s largest crude exporter, needs to foster private enterprise to diversify its oil-based economy. The fledgling private sector was hard hit by the Middle East recession as early as 1983 and several big manufacturing and trading companies ran into problems repaying loans. Renewed optimism this year stems largely from the accord reached by OPEC last December to curb oil output and boost prices to a benchmark level of 18 dlrs per barrel. With oil prices recovering, Saudi Arabia went ahead at the turn of the year with long-delayed budget plans incorporating a 52.7 billion riyal deficit to be bridged by drawing down foreign reserves. The simple act of publishing a budget restored a measure of confidence to the business community. Some share prices have risen by more than 35 pct since last November, while banks are generally reporting a slowdown in the number of new non-performing loans. But not all bankers are convinced. One senior corporate finance manager in Riyadh said: \"Banks are still reluctant to lend ... There is certainly more optimism in the air, but I am not sure if it is firmly based.\" Some businessmen and bankers point out that government spending is still under tight control and the non-oil economy may still be contracting. Capital expenditure on large projects has been cut sharply. A U.S. Embassy report on Saudi Arabia published just before the budget said: \"While industrialisation has continued to be one of the government\\'s highest priorities, the recession, the payments problem and the lack of financing have reduced Saudi and foreign investor interest in industry.\" It is the lack of fresh investment that is expected to be a major issue among the businessmen gathered here. Official figures show the number of new licences for industrial ventures fell 24 pct in the six months to March 1986, compared with the same period in 1985. Lending by the Saudi Industrial Development Fund, a major source of industry backing, has fallen steadily since 1983. Trading companies have also been hit, some caught with huge inventories of construction equipment as recession bit. Some firms laid off workers and cut bloated inventories. Others have effectively been liquidated. A few have reached agreement with bankers to extend debt repayments. The latest rescheduling is for the shipping-to-hotels conglomerate REDEC. Its negotiators have just initialled a draft accord to restructure payments on 1.3 billion riyals of bank debt. Bankers and businessmen said the conference was also likely to discuss the apparent reluctance of U.S. And British firms to step up investment in the kingdom. A British government delegation has just left Riyadh after holding preliminary talks on ways of offsetting the huge Saudi outlay on a defence contract to supply 132 fighter aircraft worth five billion stg. MEES SAYS SECOND WEEK MARCH OPEC OUTPUT 14 MLN BPD OPEC produced only about 14 mln bpd of oil in the second week of March -- 1.8 mln bpd below its ceiling -- largely because of pipeline problems in Turkey and Ecuador, the Middle East Economic Survey (MEES) estimated. A landslide breached Iraq\\'s one mln bpd pipeline through Turkey on March 6 for a week, and earthquakes in Ecuador have shut down its export pipeline for four to five months. Ecuador has an OPEC quota of 210,000 bpd. MEES put Saudi Arabian output at 2.9 mln bpd in the first week of March and 3.1 mln bpd in the second, in addition to output from the Neutral Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. MEES said Saudi Arabia was pumping more than 300,000 bpd of its total production into floating storage. Saudi Oil Minister Hisham Nazer told Reuters and the television news agency Visnews yesterday that Saudi output, including Neutral Zone production, was around three mln bpd. The Cyprus-based newsletter also said authoritative Libyan oil sources said Libya was producing 850,000 bpd, compared with its 948,000 bpd quota, and that actual liftings are much lower than that. It said one major Libyan equity producer had partially stopped lifting its 55,000 bpd equity entitlement for March because Libya was insisting on official prices, but is still lifting 40,000 bpd of debt crude at official prices and a further 25,000 bpd of \"purchase crude.\" It said small equity producers, with entitlements of only 2,000 to 3,000 bpd, had also told Tripoli they could not lift at official prices. MEES said Iraq had sent a telex to OPEC and member countries calling for the formation of a committee to study what it said were inequalities in marketing potential among various members. The newsletter said the Iraqi letter indicated Baghdad was having difficulty selling crude at official prices. The Iraqi telex pointed out that some member countries export substantial volumes of oil that are not subject to OPEC price regulations -- exports of refined products, equity crude on which the margins are equivalent to covert discounts and \"other forms of hydrocarbons\" which are marketed in package deals with crude oil. ECUADOR SAYS IT WILL PAY DEBT WHEN IT CAN President Leon Febres Cordero said Ecuador would honour its debt when it had the capacity to make payments, but said foreign banks had calculated oil would have to be 25 dlrs a barrel for Ecuador to meet its commitments. Ecuador said on Friday that last week\\'s earthquake was forcing it to reaffirm an earlier decision -- based on the slide in world oil prices -- to suspend debt payments to private foreign banks, which hold two-thirds of its 8.16 billion dlr foreign debt. \"All legitimate debt is a commitment of honour,\" the president said during a visit to the quake zone. \"A government as a sovereign entity has dignity and prestige to maintain.\" Private foreign banks and the World Bank had calculated oil would have to be at least 25 dlrs a barrel for Quito to be able to meet its commitments, Febres Cordero said. He added that Ecuadorean crude was now selling for 15 to 17 dlrs a barrel after having been sold for many months at 12 dlrs a barrel and as low as seven dlrs before that. Meanwhile, Ecuador announced an austerity program and a price freeze on key consumer goods as a result of the earthquake, which killed at least 300 people. Presidency Minister Patricio Quevedo said the budget would be cut by five to 10 pct, government hiring would be frozen and salaries of top officials, including the president and cabinet, would be reduced. He also said a price freeze would be imposed on 20 basic consumer items, mainly food staples, while the price of gasoline would rise by between 69 and 80 pct and bus fares would rise by 20 pct. Gasoline supplies would also be limited. PARIBAS SEEKING TO ADJUST ECUADOR OIL FACILITY Banque Paribas, which arranged a 220 mln dlr loan for Ecuador last year to pre-finance oil exports, wants to adjust the terms of the facility to help the country recover from a devastating earthquake, bankers said. But the French bank\\'s plan, which would effectively postpone repayment of about 30 mln dlrs of the loan for several months, is running into stiff resistance from many of the 52 members of the loan syndicate. The pipeline that carries all Ecuador\\'s oil exports was ruptured in the March 5 tremor and will take some five months to repair at a cost of about 150 mln dlrs to repair. President Leon Febres Cordero on Friday estimated total damages caused by the quake at one billion dlrs and said that Ecuador as a result would maintain January\\'s suspension of interest payments on its foreign commercial bank debt. Payments were halted in January because of the drop in the price of oil, which accounts for nearly two-thirds of Ecuador\\'s export earnings and 60 pct of government revenue. Although sympathetic to Ecuador\\'s plight, many banks in the Paribas facility feel that emergency financial relief is a job for international financial organizations and not for commercial banks, bankers said. The 18-month oil-financing facility, which was signed last October 28, is one of the few purely voluntary credits for a Latin American nation since the region\\'s debt crisis erupted in August 1982. Because it was a voluntary deal, many bankers feel strongly that the orginal terms must be adhered to. Otherwise, they fear, the gradual re-establishment of normal market conditions for Latin borrowers will be set back. \"There\\'s a lot of reluctance by the other banks. They feel it\\'s a different facility, and so any kind of suggestion of a restructuring would look bad,\" one banker commented. SAUDI OIL MINISTER SEES NO NEED TO ALTER PACT Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Hisham Nazer said OPEC\\'s December agreement to stabilize oil prices at 18 dlrs a barrel was being implemented satisfactorily and there was no immediate need to change it. Nazer, in an interview with Reuters and the television news agency Visnews, said Saudi Arabia was producing around three mln barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil, well below its OPEC quota. Saudi Arabia, the world\\'s largest oil exporter, will continue to restrain production as long as other OPEC members adhere to the pact, Nazer said. The 13-nation OPEC agreed in December to cut its production ceiling by 7.25 pct to 15.8 mln bpd and abide by fixed prices averaging 18 dlrs a barrel from February 1. Nazer, in his first interview since succeeding Ahmed Zaki Yamani last October, said: \"I do not foresee any need for new measures before the 25th of June when our (next OPEC) meeting will take place as scheduled.\" Nazer said OPEC was producing below 15.8 mln bpd and all members were abiding by its agreements. \"We\\'ve heard news every now and then of violations but they were not at all verified,\" he said.

He said it was up to countries that declined to cooperate -- such as Britain -- to come up with their own proposals if they saw fit. SAUDIS DROP CONDITION FOR OIL SALE TO BRAZIL Saudi Arabia has dropped its condition that Brazil secure international bank guarantees before Saudia Arabia would ship it oil, state-oil company Petrobras said in a statement. Petrobras said the Saudis will accept Banco do Brasil credit guarantees. Petrobras cancelled a 40 mln dlr crude oil purchase from the Saudis yesterday after they refused to accept a letter of credit from the official Bank of Brazil. The Saudis had demanded that Brazil get credit guarantees from leading international banks. Petrobras said the Saudis had been advised that if they did not change their mind by Monday, Petrobras would negotiate the purchase of oil with other producers. The Petrobras statement said the shipment of 2.2 mln barrels will be made by the Saudis on March 24 as scheduled. The shipment was part of a contract signed in February for the Saudis to supply Brazil with 125,000 barrels per day until June. UNOCAL &lt;UCL> UNIT CUTS CRUDE OIL POSTED PRICES Unocal Corp\\'s Union Oil Co said it lowered its posted prices for crude oil one to 1.50 dlrs a barrel in the eastern region of the U.S., effective Feb 26. Union said a 1.50 dlrs cut brings its posted price for the U.S. benchmark grade, West Texas Intermediate, to 16 dlrs. Louisiana Sweet also was lowered 1.50 dlrs to 16.35 dlrs, the company said. No changes were made in Union\\'s posted prices for West Coast grades of crude oil, the company said. NORWAY APPROVES TRADE BAN AGAINST SOUTH AFRICA Norway\\'s parliament has approved an extensive trade ban against South Africa but left shipowners a key loophole through which controversial oil shipments on Norwegian tankers may continue, government officials said. The unilateral boycott, proposed by Norway\\'s minority Labour government, gives domestic companies until late September to cut remaining trade ties with South Africa and Namibia. \"The legislation discussed today must not be seen as an isolated measure, but as a step in an international process,\" Norway\\'s foreign minister Thorvald Stoltenberg told parliament. Government officials said they hope the move will intensify international pressure against the Pretoria regime\\'s apartheid policies. Sweden, in a similar move last week, promised to halt all trade with South Africa by October. Norway\\'s boycott, although forbidding crude oil shipments to South Africa on Norwegian-owned tankers, makes an important exception for ships whose final destination is decided while they are at sea. Oil cargoes are often resold by trades after loading, making it difficult for shipowners to know their ships\\' final port at the start of a voyage. Critics said the bill leaves the door open for continued oil shipments to South Africa. They called for stricter sanctions to stop all Norwegian shipping to South Africa. Norwegian tankers supplied South Africa with about 30 pct of its crude imports during the early 1980s, but the trade has dropped sharply to just one cargo in the last three months, trade ministry officials said. The latest trade figures show Norwegian imports from South Africa dropped 36 pct to 160 mln crowns during the first eight months of 1986, while exports plunged 52 pct to 265 mln crowns from the year-ago figure. \"Many would say that the law has already had its effect because of the dramatic drop in trade between South African and Norway,\" Foreign Ministry spokesman Per Paust told Reuters. \"Norwegian business at an early stage started restructuring its relations with South Africa in anticipation of the law. \"No one has said the boycott will have a profound effect on international trade with South Africa, but it is an important political statement by the Norwegian government,\" he said. The Oslo government said it will review the effects of the ban on Norwegian industry after two years and may propose amendments if industry can show it is hurt by the law. Norwegian imports from South Africa are limited mainly to high-grade manganese and coppernickle ores used in it ferro-alloys and light metals industries. Metals manufacturers estimate some 2,000 jobs could be affected by the boycott is suitable replacements for these ores are not found. The legislation now goes on to the upper house for formal ratification later this week, parliamentarians said. GOTAAS-LARSEN &lt;GOTLF> TO BUILD FIFTH CARRIER Gotaas-Larsen Shipping Corp said it had exercised an option to build a fifth in a series of crude oil carriers to be constructed by &lt;Daewoo Shipbuilding and Heavy Machinery Ltd> in South Korea. PACIFIC RESOURCES &lt;PRI> INSTALLS OIL MOORING Pacific Resources Inc said it has installed a CALM (Catenary Anchor Leg Mooring) single-point mooring terminal off the southwest coast of Oahu at its Hawaiian Independent Refinery at a cost of 3.5 mln dlrs. The system transfers crude and fuel oils from tankers to the refinery\\'s tank farm and carries refined products to ships for export, PRI said. Company chairman Robert G. Reed said the new mooring system will permit 24-hour service in most kinds of weather and will reduce ship turnaround time. He said the mooring is the first of its kind in the U.S. The new system can accomodate vessels up to 150,000 deadweight tons, or one mln barrels of cargo, PRI said. SENATE COMMITTEE MAY LOOK AT FUEL TAX PROPOSALS The Senate budget committee sits down tomorrow to start drafting a fiscal 1988 budget, with the budget writers expected to look at several proposals for fuel taxes and other tax options to cut the budget. In a briefing book for the drafting sessions, a number of revenue raising tax options are proposed, including a five dlrs a barrel fee on domestic and imported oil, a fee just on imported oil, and a broad based tax on domestic energy consumption based on five pct of value. Other proposals include various excise taxes and combinations of import surcharges or tariffs, including a 10 pct import across the board import surcharge that would raise 22 billion dlrs next year alone, more in later years. The committee, however, will only include revenue numbers in its proposed budget with the actual revenue decisions left to the House and Senate tax-writing committees. The committee will draft a budget which its chairman, Sen Lawton Chiles, a Florida Democrat, said he hopes would raise at least 18 billion dlrs in revenues, or about half the minimum 36 billion dlr deficit reduction he has in mind. The House Budget Committee also plans to start drafting a separate budget plan later this week, which would have to be reconciled with the Senate version. The final budget would be the fiscal 1988 spending and revenue blueprint. STUDY PREDICTS U.S. DEPENDENCE ON FOREIGN OIL A government study has concluded the U.S. Will be dependent on oil from the middle east into the next century and must take steps to reduce its vulnerability, the New York Times said. The newspaper said the inter-agency government study found a serious oil-dependency problem due to steadily falling domestic production and rising demand for imported oil. The study concluded that by 1995 the U.S. Will be relying on foreign countries for 50 pct of its oil, more than the peak of 48 pct reached in 1977 and far above the 33 pct rate during the 1973-74 Arab oil embargo. The U.S. Now imports about 38 pct of its oil needs, up from 27 pct a year ago, the New York Times said. It said recommendations sent to the White House by Energy Secretary John Harrington include financial incentives to raise domestic oil production by one mln barrels a day from the current 8.4 mln barrels. The newspaper said the administration has placed increased emphasis on stockpiling oil reserves. It said the view now held is that the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to be tapped in times of shortages, should be increased by 100,000 barrels a day, rather than 35,000 as called for in the 1988 budget. The newspaper said Harrington may propose restoring the depletion allowance to major producers. \"The administration also plans to renew its efforts to ...Repeal the windfall profits tax, remove bars to drilling on the outer continental shelf and repeal the law that limits the use of natural gas in industrial and utility boilers,\" it added. The New York Times quoted Senator Don Nickles of Oklahoma as saying the study greatly underestimated potential U.S. Demand for imported oil in the next decade and overestimated the amount of domestic oil which would be produced. LOOPHOLE FOR TANKERS IN NORWAY\\'S S. AFRICA BAN Norway\\'s parliament has approved an extensive trade ban against South Africa but left shipowners a key loophole through which controversial oil shipments on Norwegian tankers may continue, government officials said. The unilateral boycott gives domestic companies until late September to cut trade ties with South Africa and Namibia. Although forbidding crude oil shipments to South Africa on Norwegian-owned tankers, the boycott makes a crucial exception for ships whose final destination is decided while at sea. As oil cargoes are often resold after loading, critics said the door will be left open for continued shipments to South Africa.

IRAN SAID TO ATTACK CYPRIOT TANKER A Cypriot tanker was set ablaze in the Persian Gulf yesterday after an Iranian gunboat fired missiles at it, shipping sources quoting reports from Japanese tankers said today. No casualties were seen and the tanker Pivot, laden with crude oil, was towed towards Dubai by tugs after they put out the fire, the sources said. Iranian gunboats usually check a ship\\'s nationality and cargo before attacking but the Pivot was hit near Bu Musa island without warning, they added. SHEARSON LEHMAN UPGRADES U.S. OIL STOCKS Analyst Sanford Margoshes of Shearson Lehman Brothers said he recommended a number of oil stocks today now that it is apparent that OPEC has succeeded in holding to its prescribed production quotas. \"It is clear that OPEC, through jawboning and quota restraint, will boost the price of oil,\" Margoshes said. Prices of oil stocks rose sharply today in response to higher oil prices and optimism about OPEC quotas. Margoshes said he recommends Imperial Oil &lt;IMO.A>, up 1/2 to 49-1/8, Standard Oil Co &lt;SRD>, 7/8 to 62-3/4, Exxon &lt;XON> one to 83-1/8, and Chevron &lt;CHV> 1-1/8 to 54-7/8. In addition, Margoshes said he recommended Atlantic Richfield &lt;ARC> on a short-term basis, though he said he is still suspect about its debt situation. Atlantic Richfield rose 1-3/4 to 77. He said \"the market could come down to test the 16 dlr a barrel level again, but the main thrust of investing in oil is positive right now. Before the year is out we will see higher oil prices.\" He noted that belief that the government is interested in raising the strategic reserves is factored into the rise in oil stocks today. EXXON &lt;XON> MAY CLOSE ONE FRENCH REFINERY Exxon Corp, the world\\'s largest oil company, said in a published interview today that it was reviewing its worldwide refinery operations and might decide to close on of its french refineries. Lee R. Raymond, Exxon\\'s new president, singled out the possibility of a closure of one of Exxon\\'s refineries in France during the interview. An Exxon spokeswoman confirmed that Raymond had specifically mentioned refineries in France but said that no specific refinery had been named. She also said that all of Exxon\\'s opertations were under constant review. Exxon currently has two refineries in France, FOS in the mediterranean with a capcity of 175,000 barrels per day and Port Jerome west of paris with a similar capacity. Petroleum Intelligence Weekly, an influential trade journal, said, in its current issue, that they understood that Exxon was looking at the possibility of refinery closures in Antwerp, Southern France or possibly Italy. Paul Mlotok, oil analyst with Salomon Brothers inc said that with the closures Exxon made in 1986 in Europe and the improvement in the European refining situation, its future profits there should be good. \"Exxon and other major oil companies have closed a bunch of refineries in Europe, upgraded the rest and shaken many of the indepedents out of the market. Now with demand for products rising and efficient operations, Exxon should show superior earnings,\" Mlotok said. \"Just after Royal Dutch &lt;RD>, they are seen as one of the highest grade refiners in Europe,\" he added. Industry sources said that the oil companies were likely to feel greater pressure on their operations in Southern Europe where competition from the OPEC countries is increasing as these producers move further into downstream operations. PIW said that refiners in the Mediterranean can expect increased shipments from Saudi Arabia and other OPEC export refineries. PIW said \"sales from Libya, Algeria and elsewhere are expected to reclaim markets lost to Italian and other European refiners as a result of the abundance of cheap netback oil last year.\" LAWSON OIL TAX BREAKS TO HELP NEW FIELDS - REVENUE Two new U.K. Tax relief measures for oil producers, announced today, are aimed at encouraging developments in the North Sea to go ahead and boost opportunities for the offshore supplies industry, the Inland Revenue said in a post-budget statement. Earlier, Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson announced in his annual budget to Parliament that from today, companies will be allowed to offset up to 10 pct of qualifying development expenditure on certain future oil fields against Petroleum Revenue Tax (PRT). To date, full relief was allowed for expenditure on an individual field itself, when its income stream began, but was not immediately available against other development expenditure, the statement said. The new relief will apply to fields outside the southern basin for which development consent is first given on or after today, and will improve the post-tax economics of new developments and encourage companies to proceed with project which might have been delayed, it said. Lawson also announced that he would henceforth allow certain expenditure on oil related research which does not at present qualify for PRT relief to be offset against PRT liability. This means oil-related expenditure in the U.K. Or on the U.K. Continental shelf, which has not become allowable in a particular field within three years of being incurred, to be allowed against PRT liability in any oil field, the Inland Revenue said. This brings the scope of PRT relief for research costs more in line with corporation tax relief measures, and is planned to encourage general research into ways of reducing field development costs, it said. In due course, the industry should benefit by over 100 mln stg a year, it calculated. The Inland Revenue statement also included other technical measures that Lawson did not comment on in his budget speech. These included measures to allow companies to balance their shares of PRT-exempt oil allowances through reallocation in two past periods of allowance utilisation. Tidier rules on incorrectly allowed PRT expenditure reliefs were announced, while there were also ammendments on rules on corporation tax and Advance Corporation Tax relating to the so-called \"ring fence\" of activities in the U.K. And its continental shelf. The Finance Bill will have provisions for the implementation of measures announced in November, it said. Gareth Lewis Davies, a North Sea expert with stockbrokers Wood Mackenzie and Co Inc in Edinburgh, thought the two reliefs on PRT would help the depressed offshore industry. He said the 10 pct cross field allowance relief would favour chances that development of smaller North Sea fields such Osprey, Don and Arbroath would be brought forward. Early development of the larger Miller and Bruce oil fields might also be encouraged, he said. Lewis Davies said the measure might also aid the offshore construction industry, which suffered a huge amount of lay-offs under the price slump of more than 50 pct last year. He pointed out that the relief only applies to the development of new fields outside the Southern Basin. This means more jobs could be created, as the fields in the central and northern sectors of the North Sea are deeper than in the south and thus have greater capital and labour requirements as the waters are deeper than in the south. He said the PRT relief for certain research expenditure would help fundamental research in the oil industry, although the benefits of this research would not be seen for several year. PLAINS &lt;PLNS> POSTS RESERVES INCREASES Plains Resources Inc said that as of December 31, its estimated proved oil and gas reserves rose by 27 pct to 5.43 mln barrels from 4.27 mln barrels and proved developed reserves rose 16 pct to four mln barrels from 3.45 mln barrels a year ago. The company said its year end reserves did not include the oil and gas reserves of Houston Oil Fields Co which recently agreed to merge with it, pending shareholder approval in mid-April. If approved, the merger will add another 3.2 mln barrels to the company\\'s reserve base. U.S. WARNS OF DEPENDENCE ON FOREIGN OIL A White House-ordered report said that growing U.S. reliance on foreign oil into the year 2000 could have potentially damaging implications for national security. The Energy Department study discusses several options to curb reliance on foreign oil, but makes no recommendations. President Reagan and most Congressmen have previously ruled out a tax on foreign oil as a way to curb imports and to help the depressed domestic oil industry. Energy Secretary John Herrington said in a statement that \"although we have made gains in energy security in the last six years, this report shows that there is justification for national concern both over declining competitiveness of our domestic oil and gas industry and over rising oil imports.\" The report said imports last year were 33 pct of U.S. consumption and by the mid-1990s could rise to 50 pct. Among the report\\'s options to ease U.S. reliance on foreign oil are several already advocated by the Reagan Administration. President Reagan ordered the study last September, citing a determination that the country never again become captive to a foreign oil cartel, referring to the OPEC-led oil shortages and sharp prices increases of the 1970s. The report said an import fee would raise prices and help make it economical for U.S. oil firms to find and produce new oil, as well as to cut imports, but on the whole the tax would depress the nation\\'s economy. U.S OIL TAX WOULD NOT AFFECT PDVSA-CHAMPLIN DEAL an eventual oil import fee in the united states will make no difference to champlin petroleum corp\\'s joint venture agreement signed today with petroleos de venezuela (pdvsa), champlin chairman william adams said. \"this was an aspect which was discussed at length during the negotiations, but we can say our contract covers all eventualities in this regard,\" he told reuters during the signing ceremony here. Venezuela\\'s energy and mines minister arturo hernandez grisanti earlier described the agreement, under which pdvsa buys 50 pct of champlin\\'s corpus christi refinery, as \"one more step in the maturation and presence of our oil industry in world markets.\" union pacific chairman william cook said the agreement will be beneficial to both sides, combining a secure source of supply with a modern refinery and access to markets. \"we are looking to a long-term relationship, and at a time of protectionist tendencies in the U.S. Congress there are clear benefits to both sides,\" he said. Adams said pdvsa crude would remain competitive even with an oil import fee because champlin had invested heavily over the years in adapingthe texas refinery to process venezuelan heavy crudes with coking and hydro-treating facilities and obtain a competitive product yield. \"therefore while the danger of an oil import fee has been a consideration in the negotiations, and it remains to be seen what such a fee would represent, we do not foresee any impact on today\\'s agreement,\" adams said. He said the refinery could run crude as heavy as venezuela\\'s bolivar coastal field (bcf) 17 api without any difficultiesand would probably move over time to a heavier diet to take advantage of bigger margins. The refinery has a capacity to process up to 110,000 bpd of venezuelan high sulphur content heavy crude, with an 80-85 pct yield of white products. HERRINGTON SAYS HE MAY RECOMMEND TAX BENEFITS FOR U.S. OIL INDUSTRY HERRINGTON SAYS HE MAY RECOMMEND TAX BENEFITS FOR U.S. OIL INDUSTRY HERRINGTON SAYS HE MAY CALL FOR OIL TAX BENEFITS Energy Secretary John Herrington said he may recommend to the White House that the domestic oil industry be given tax benefits to help it produce more oil and head off increasing U.S. dependence on foreign oil. He said also at a news conference that he would recommend to the White House that the fill rate of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve be increased from its planned 35,000 barrels per day. The oil reserve fill rate capacity is 100,000 barrels a day. Herrington said he had always advocated a greater fill rate for the petroleum reserve, but the rate had been kept down because of budgetary constraints. Herrington did not disclose what tax incentives he might advocate, but U.S. officials have shown interest in tax benefits for oil and gas exploration and for research and development into new ways to extract oil which is now considered uneconomical to produce. He made the remarks in conjunction with the release of the Energy Department\\'s study on oil\\'s impact on national security. Herrington said that before he disclosed what recommendations for tax benefits for the oil and gas industry he might make, he would raise the matter with the White House Economic Policy Committee to see if the proposals to increase oil production made good tax policy. He said he would like to increase U.S. production by one mln barrels a day. The report said that by the end of the century the United States may be relying on foreign sources for 50 pct of its oil consumption, posing a serious economic and national security threat. WAINCO OIL &lt;WOL> COMPLETES WILDCAT WELL Wainco Oil Corp said it has completed a wildcat well on its GrandMarais prspect in Jefferson Davis Parish, La., which is currently producing at a rate of 1.1 mln cubic feet of gas and 40 barrels of condensate daily. The company said it has a 20 pct working interest in the well which is flowing from Lower Frion Tweedel Sand perforations between 10,104 and 10,110 feet. Additional untested but possibly productive zones exist behind the pipe, it added. It said the remaining owners are privately held petroleum companies. U.S. WARNS OF DEPENDENCE ON FOREIGN OIL A White House-ordered report said that growing U.S. reliance on foreign oil into the year 2000 could have potentially damaging implications for national security. The Energy Department study discusses several options to curb reliance on foreign oil, but makes no recommendations. President Reagan and most Congressmen have previously ruled out a tax on foreign oil as a way to curb imports and to help the depressed domestic oil industry. Energy Secretary John Herrington said in a statement that \"although we have made gains in energy security in the last six years, this report shows that there is justification for national concern both over declining competitiveness of our domestic oil and gas industry and over rising oil imports.\" The report said imports last year were 33 pct of U.S. consumption and by the mid-1990s could rise to 50 pct. Among the report\\'s options to ease U.S. reliance on foreign oil are several already advocated by the Reagan Administration. President Reagan ordered the study last September, citing a determination that the country never again become captive to a foreign oil cartel, referring to the OPEC-led oil shortages and sharp prices increases of the 1970s. The report said an import fee would raise prices and help make it economical for U.S. oil firms to find and produce new oil, as well as to cut imports, but on the whole the tax would depress the nation\\'s economy. The study was outlined in a New York Times report today. OPEC WANTS 18 DLR OIL PRICE - OAPEC OFFICIAL OPEC believes world oil prices should be set around a fixed average price of 18 dlrs a barrel, OAPEC Assistant General Secretary Abdelaziz Al-Wattari said today. In a speech to a European Community (EC)/OAPEC/OPEC seminar in Luxembourg released here, Al-Wattari said: \"OPEC believes ...The world energy trade should be kept without restrictions and should be built around a fixed average price of 18 dlrs.\" But he warned that defense of the 18 dlr a barrel level had caused hardship for OPEC countries, who had been forced to curtail production, and he warned that such cutbacks by OPEC states could not be sustained in some cases. \"For OPEC to stabilize the world oil price at what is now considered the optimal level of 18 dlrs a barrel, its member countries have had to undergo severe hardship in curtailing production,\" Al-Wattari said. \"Such cutbacks ... Cannot, in certain cases, be sustained,\" Al-Wattari said. As well as financial and marketing pressures, some states depended on associated gas output for domestic use and oil cutbacks had left insufficient gas supplies, he added. Al-Wattari noted that total OPEC output was below the organization\\'s agreed ceiling for all member countries in February, although this had meant sacrifices. The effect of these sacrifices meant that market stability, though restored to a good level, was still under pressure, Al-Wattari said. \"A lasting stability in the world market requires a wider scope of international cooperation,\" he added. He said some non-OPEC oil producing countries had shown a political willingness after 1986 to cooperate with OPEC. But although cutbacks announced by these states were politically significant and welcomed by OPEC, they were insufficient in terms of volume, he added. \"The overall majority of non-OPEC producers have not responded sufficiently to OPEC\\'s calls for supply regulation,\" he said. Al-Wattari said an 18 dlr a barrel price was optimal as it allowed investment in the oil industry outside OPEC to continue, while not generating excessive cash flow for otherwise unviable high-cost areas outside OPEC. Such a price would no longer encourage protectionist measures, he added. Fadhil Al-Chalabi, OPEC Deputy Secretary General, also addressing the seminar, added that discipline was still needed to prevent violent fluctuations in the oil market. Cooperation between Arab states and Europe was advantageous for both sides, Al-Chalabi said, adding he hoped cooperation would ultimately lead to full-fledged Euro-Arab dialogue. VENEZUELA-ECUADOR OIL LOAN UNDER DISCUSSION Venezuela has still to work out final details of its plan to supply Ecuador with 50,000 barrels per day of crude oil to compensate that country for lost exports caused by earthquake damage, a senior Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA) official said. \"We have yet to finalize details on how the compensation will be carried out and how OPEC production quotas will be affected,\" he said during the signing of a joint venture deal with Union Pacific Corp today. He said an agreement was initialled on a visit last week by Ecuador\\'s deputy energy minister Fernando Santos Alvite. He pointed out that there are some contractual points to be considered. Venezuela, possibly unique among oil exporters, requires its clients to sign final destination clauses to ensure its oil is not resold on the spot market. Ecuador\\'s oil minister Javier Espinosa was quoted today as saying Venezuela will export the oil on Ecuador\\'s account and remit the revenues to Quito. Ecuador would pay back the oil at a rate of 35,000 bpd. He said Venezuela\\'s oil would be traded through Ecuadorean state oil company Cepe, but the PDVSA official said the company never allows third parties to trade its oil. U.K. OIL REVENUE FORECAST TO FALL IN 1987/88 The U.K. Government forecasts that oil revenues will fall to four billion stg in the fiscal year 1987/88, from 4.75 billion in 1986/87 and 11.5 billion in 1985/86. The forecast came in the Treasury\\'s Financial Statement and Budget Report issued after the Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson\\'s annual budget statement to parliament. The government is assuming the price of oil will average 15 dlrs a barrel, in line with its earlier forecasts, and its oil revenue calculation is based on an exchange rate remaining close to current levels, the Treasury document said. The Treasury said the 1987/88 oil revenue shortfall will reflect the oil price fall of 1986, as North Sea corporation tax is paid after a time lag. The statement calculated that a one dlr a barrel difference in oil prices this year will change revenue by about 350 mln stg for the current fiscal year, and 400 mln stg in a full year. Oil production is forecast to fall slightly in 1987, according to the statement. A change in one mln tonnes in production would alter revenue by about 45 mln stg in 1987/88 and 50 mln stg in a full year, it added. Total general government receipts for 1986/87 are now estimated to be 159.2 billion stg, 2.75 billion more than the 1986 Budget forecasts and above the Autumn Statement forecasts, despite a shortfall of 1.25 billlion in oil receipts. Additional non-North Sea corporation tax of 1.75 billion stg and VAT of 750 mln stg account for the bulk of the overshoot. Total general government receipts were forecast to rise to 168.8 billion stg in fiscal 1987/88, and among the main items, besides diminishing oil revenues, were projected income tax of 40 billion stg, up from 38.4 billion in the current year. Non-North Sea corporation tax is forecast to bring in 13.5 billion stg in 1987/88, after the revised 11.2 billion in 1986/87, and VAT revenue should amount to 23.3 billion, compared with upwardly revised estimated 21.5 billion this fiscal year. The general government expenditure for the coming fiscal year is expected to total 173.5 billion stg, up from a revised 164.9 billion in the current year. A repayment of 800 mln on public corporations\\' market and overseas borrowings is forecast to bring the total Public Sector Borrowing Requirement down to 3.9 billion stg in 1987/88, from this year\\'s revised 4.1 billion, the Treasury said. OPEC WANTS 18 DLR OIL PRICE - OAPEC OFFICIAL OPEC believes world oil prices should be set around a fixed average price of 18 dlrs a barrel, OAPEC Assistant General Secretary Abdelaziz Al-Wattari said. In a speech to a European Community/OAPEC/OPEC seminar in Luxembourg released here, Al-Wattari said, \"OPEC believes ...the world energy trade should be kept without restrictions and should be built around a fixed average price of 18 dlrs.\" Al-Wattari noted that total OPEC output was below the organization\\'s agreed ceiling for all member countries in February, although this had meant sacrifices. The effect of these sacrifices meant that market stability, though restored to a good level, was still under pressure, Al-Wattari said. \"A lasting stability in the world market requires a wider scope of international cooperation,\" he said. SENATOR SAYS ENERGY REPORT ASSUMPTIONS FLAWED Sen. Pete Domenici, a main sponsor of legislation to set an oil import fee, said the administration\\'s energy security report was based on flawed economic assumptions. The New Mexico Republican said the report did not take into account the last few weeks\\' drop in domestic oil production in its statement that an oil fee would raise prices for consumers. The report said a decline in economic growth as a result of the fee would reduce tax revenues. \"A five dlr (per barrel) oil import fee will provide the stimulus to create jobs and investment, \" and raise revenues, he said. API SAYS DISTILLATE STOCKS OFF 7.35 MLN BBLS, GASOLINE OFF 2.89 MLN, CRUDE OFF 4.39 MLN API SAYS DISTILLATE STOCKS OFF 7.35 MLN BBLS, GASOLINE OFF 2.89 MLN, CRUDE OFF 4.39 MLN API SAYS DISTILLATE, GAS STOCKS OFF IN WEEK Distillate fuel stocks held in primary storage fell by 7.35 mln barrels in the week ended March 13 to 112.74 mln barrels from a revised 120.09 mln the previous week, the American Petroleum Institute (API) said. In its weekly statistical bulletin, the oil industry trade group said gasoline stocks fell 2.89 mln barrels to 248.44 mln barrels from a revised 251.33 mln, and crude oil stocks dropped 4.39 mln barrels to 325.13 mln from a revised 329.52 mln. It said residual fuel stocks fell 250,000 barrels to 35.73 mln from 35.98 mln barrels. API said refinery runs in the week rose to 11.80 mln barrels per day (bpd) from a revised 11.70 mln and refinery use of operating capacity was 75.7 pct, up from a revised 75.0 pct. Crude oil imports in the week rose to 3.66 mln bpd from a revised 2.67 mln, API added. KUWAIT SAYS NO OPEC MEMBER VIOLATING OUTPUT QUOTA Kuwaiti Oil Minister Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah said in a newspaper interview that no OPEC member was exceeding oil production quotas allocated by the 13-nation group. Sheikh Ali told Kuwait\\'s daily al-Anba \"All OPEC states, without exception, are producing within the quotas allocated to them. Some of them are producing less.\" Some oil industry sources had said the United Arab Emirates, which had been generally been producing over its quota since OPEC returned to quotas last September, was still pumping more than its allotted amount in the first months of this year. Ecuador had also publicly stated it was over its quota, but an earthquake early this month stopped that. Iraq has rejected its quota, but oil sources say it may be having problems marketing at official prices all the oil it wants to sell. OPEC agreed in December to cut overall oil production by 7.25 pct to 15.8 mln barrels per day (bpd) for the first six months of this year and abide by fixed prices around 18 dlrs a barrel from February 1. IRAQ SAYS IT ATTACKS TWO SHIPS IN GULF Iraq said its warplanes hit two ships off the Iranian coast in attacks last night and early today. The planes \"dealt accurate and effective blows to both maritime targets before they returned safely to base,\" a military spokesman told the Iraqi new agency INA. There was no immediate confirmation of the attacks from Persian Gulf shipping sources. The last confirmed Iraqi attack on shipping was on March 8, when an Iranian tanker was hit by a missile south of Iran\\'s Kharg island oil export terminal. Gulf shipping sources yesterday reported an Iranian warship had set the Cypriot supertanker Pivot on fire with a missile. They said there were no injuries on board and the ship headed for the Gulf Emirate of Fujairah under its own power after the fire was put out. The Pivot was the 18th ship hit this year in the maritime extension of the 6-1/2 year-old Iran-Iraq war. TEXACO &lt;TX> TO CEASE POSTING TEXAS OIL PRICE Texaco Refining and Marketing, an operating subsidiary of Texaco Inc, said it would cease to post crude oil prices for West Texas crudes at the end of this month following a decision to discontinue purchase of crude oil from leases, a Texaco spokesman in Houston said. But it will continue to purchase quantities of U.S. and foreign crude oil for use in its refinery system, he added. The spokesman also said Texaco Trading and Transport Inc would continue to acquire and market Texaco lease production as well as other lease production. The company will continue to post a Louisiana price, it said. MALAYSIA TO CUT OIL OUTPUT FURTHER, TRADERS SAY Malaysia\\'s state oil company Petronas will cut oil production to 420,000 barrels per day (bpd) from May 1, trade sources said. Malaysia cut its 510,000 bpd target output by 10 pct last September to support Opec moves to boost prices, and the latest cut would reduce output by 17.5 pct from 1986\\'s target level. Petronas said in February that Malaysia would maintain its 10 pct production cutback until mid-1987. However, the Finance Ministry said in its annual report that Malaysia\\'s crude oil output was expected to rise to an average 510,000 bpd in 1987. The ministry\\'s forecast assumed average 1987 crude prices at 13 dlrs/barrel (bbl), but prices have risen enough to permit further production cutbacks, the sources said. Malaysia\\'s benchmark Tapis blend fetched above 18 dlrs/bbl this year against a low of 10.50 dlrs/bbl in July, they said. Traders said further reductions by Malaysia would add to the tight spot availabilities of Asian grades caused by reduced Indonesian and Chinese crude output. The cutback will also help Malaysia maintain prices, as there is concern some buyers want to reduce term purchases due to the availability of cheaper alternatives, the sources said. In addition to term sales, Petronas has been offering two to three 400,000 bbl spot cargoes of Malaysian crude each month for sale through tender, the sources said. However, this practice is likely to dwindle given the reduced scale of production, they said. DOE SECRETARY FAVORS HIGHER SPR FILL RATE Energy Secretary John Herrington said he believes the Reagan Administration will review its decision to cut the fill rate of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve because of a department report issued yesterday warning of growing U.S. dependence on oil imports. \"As part of this study, I think the Administration will take the fill rate under review,\" Herrington said at a House Energy subcommittee hearing. The Administration has proposed cutting the fill rate from 75,000 barrels of oil per day to 35,000 bpd in fiscal year 1988 to save money. \"My personal feeling is that is too low. I favor the maximum fill rate (of 100,000 bpd),\" Herrington said. U.S. OIL TAX BREAK PROPOSAL TO BE EXAMINED The White House said a proposal for a tax break for the oil industry would undergo review. Spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said President Reagan had no position on recommendations submitted by Energy Secretary John Herrington to encourage investment in the hard hit domestic oil industry. But Fitzwater noted that Reagan did have a fundamental objection to tax rises and special tax breaks. He said that even though Herrington\\'s recommendation did not agree with existing policy, \"We\\'ll take a look at it.\" The review will be undertaken by the president\\'s Domestic Policy Council. Herrington\\'s proposal was reported by the Washington Post to have been made in a letter to Reagan submitting a study that found the United States would be importing half of its oil by the 1990s, threatening U.S. national security. U.S ENERGY SECRETARY PROPOSES OIL TAX INCENTIVES Energy Secretary John Herrington said he will propose tax incentives to increase domestic oil and natural gas exploration and production to the Reagan Administration for consideration. \"These options boost production, while avoiding the huge costs associated with proposals like an oil import fee,\" Herrington told a House Energy subcommittee hearing. \"It is my intention to submit these proposals to the domestic policy council and the cabinet for consideration and review.\" He said proposals, including an increase in the oil depletion allowance and repeal of the windfall profits tax, should be revenue neutral and promote domestic production at the least cost to the economy and the taxpayers. \"The goal of the Administration policies is to increase domestic production. I would like to shoot for one mln barrels a year.\" The proposals were based on a DOE study released yesterday warning the United States was threatened by a growing dependence on oil imports. \"We project free world dependence on Persian Gulf oil at 65 pct by 1995,\" Herrington said. He said it was too soon to say what the Administration policy on oil tax incentives would be and indicated there would be opposition to tax changes. \"Of course, to move forward with these kinds of options would require reopening tax issues settled last year (in the tax reform bill) -- an approach which has not, in general, been favored by the administration. I think what we need is to debate this within the Administration,\" he said. He said the proposals might raise gasoline prices. Herrington did not specifically confirm a report in today\\'s Washington Post that he had written to President Reagan urging an increase in the oil depletion allowance. Asked about the report by subcommittee members, Herrington said various proposals were under consideration and would be debated within the Administration to determine which would have the most benefits at the least cost. IRAQ SAYS IT HIT SHIP IN GULF OFF IRAN TODAY Iraq said its warplanes had hit a vessel in the Gulf off the Iranian coast today, the third in the past 24 hours. A military spokesman told the Iraqi news agency INA the latest attack was at 1250 GMT. It earlier reported strikes at 0650 GMT and at 1930 GMT last night. The planes \"dealt accurate and effective blows\" to the targets and returned safely to base. There was no immediate confirmation of the attacks from Gulf shipping sources. The last confirmed Iraqi attack was on on March 8, when an Iranian tanker was hit by a missile south of Iran\\'s Kharg island oil export terminal. ENERGY/DRILLING INDUSTRY The drastic cutbacks in U.S. drilling last year are rapidly deflating the United State\\'s natural gas bubble, which could bring spot shortages in gas supplies next winter and a modest recovery in the oilpatch, industry analysts said. Faltering deliverability of natural gas, a commodity that is difficult and costly to import in large quantities, could more than double the current U.S. rig count to near 2,000 by 1990, some analysts said. The need to lock in future supplies of gas for utilities and big industrial customers may also bring a resurgence of activity in the Gulf of Mexico\\'s offshore waters where some of the nation\\'s largest gas reserves are located. \"We think an upturn in U.S. drilling is imminent,\" said James Crandall, an analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc. \"Many companies appear to be switching from oil to gas drilling because they\\'re betting that the gas market will be back in balance in a year or two.\" The prospect of diminishing gas supplies is welcome news for drilling and oilfield service companies that barely survived last year\\'s plunge in oil prices from about 30 dlrs a barrel to less than half that. Today\\'s relatively stable oil prices of about 18 dlrs a barrel are not enough to spur a return to the heady days of 1981 when the U.S. drilling rig count soared to a record high of more than 4,500 and oilfield roustabouts commanded premium wages. The latest weekly Hughes Tool Co &lt;HT> rig count, a barometer of the oil industry\\'s health, showed 761 U.S. rigs active in what is traditionally the slowest time of the year. In 1986, the Hughes rig count began the year at 1,915 but dived to a post-World War II low of 663 in July as world oil prices experienced the sharpest decline in recent times. Ike Kerridge, a Hughes economist, said \"In 1986, the United States replaced only about 40 pct of the gas it used and that replacement rate won\\'t be any better this year.\" He added, \"We don\\'t have the options we do with oil. Imports of gas from Canada are limited by pipeline capacity and importing liquefied natural gas on ships will not be feasible in the next 10 years because of the cost.\" Only about 6 trillion cubic feet of additional gas reserves were discovered last year while U.S. consumption approached 16 trillion cubic feet, according to industry estimates. George Gaspar, an oil analyst with Robert W. Baird and Co agreed that the need for gas supplies would set the stage for a new cycle of gradual increases in U.S. drilling. \"We anticipate that natural gas pipelines will need to dedicate to their systems new gas reserves for 1989 and 1990 supplies. That means new drilling programs must begin no later than mid-1988,\" Gaspar said. Gasper said he sees a new drilling cycle emerging that could last until 1992 and that he expects the average rig count to peak near 2,000 in December of 1989. Much of the search for new gas reserves is likely to be conducted in the offshore waters of the Gulf of Mexico, where federal leases on unexplored areas will revert back to the government unless drilling begins in the next two or three years. Some of the industry\\'s biggest companies, such as Exxon Corp &lt;XON>, Mobil Corp MOB, and Union Texas Petroleum have already indicated plans to increase spending for drilling later this year in the Gulf of Mexico, Crandall said. For example, Conoco Inc, a Dupont &lt;DD> subsidiary, will spend 400 mln dlrs to build the Gulf of Mexico\\'s deepest production platform, which will produce 50 mln cubic feet of gas per day. But T. Boone Pickens, who has acquired huge Texas and Kansas gas reserves for his Mesa Limited Partnership &lt;MLP> in recent months, is not convinced that the drilling industry is on the verge of a recovery. Pickens predicts the U.S. rig count will soon drop below 600 and will not increase significantly until oil prices do. \"The rigs won\\'t go back to work until the price of oil gets above 30 dlrs a barrel,\" said Pickens, 58, adding he did not expect to see the rig count top 2,000 again in his lifetime. Tenneco Inc &lt;TGT>, one of the largest U.S. gas producers, is skeptical that a need for additional gas drilling exists. Tenneco vice president Joe Foster said he did not expect significant increases in drilling for gas until the early 1990s when the U.S. gas reserves life will have declined to about seven years\\' supply. Current spot market prices of about 1.50 dlrs per thousand cubic feet will need to rise to about three dlrs to spur reserve replacement, he said. U.S. ENERGY INDUSTRY SAID IN BETTER HEALTH The U.S. oil and gas industry is in better health than it was a year ago, according to testimony given to the Texas Railroad Commission at its annual state of the industry hearing today. The Commission, which regulates the state\\'s oil and gas industry, heard testimony from a number of high-level company executives reflecting a belief that the recent industry downturn had bottomed out. \"The attitude expressed here today so far is a great deal more optimistic (than last year),\" Commissioner James E. (Jim) Nugent told Reuters. \"It reflects their (the executives) belief that they are seeing the bottom of the economic cycle,\" he added, \"and with just a few reasonable breaks this industry can begin to move again.\" The energy industry was hard hit by the sharp drop in oil prices, which fell from around 30 dlrs a barrel in late 1985 to as low as 10 dlrs in mid-1986. Prices have since steadied to around 18 dlrs a barrel. At the same time, a number of company executives testified that the nation\\'s domestic exploration and production segment was still hurting and in need of government help. Production costs are considerably higher in the United States than in such areas as the Middle East and as prices fell many domestic producers were forced to shut down their operations. Currently, there are only about 760 oil rigs operating in the United States compared with an average of nearly 2,000 in 1985. Citing a study released yesterday by the Department of Energy, many said the falling production of domestic oil coupled with increasing U.S. demand, was leading to a growing dependency on imports, particularly from the politically volatile Middle East. \"In the U.S., 1986 petroleum production responded to lower prices, increasing about 2.5 pct, or 400,000 barrels per day (bpd),\" said J.S. Simon, General Manager of the Supply Department at Exxon Corp &lt;XON>, the nation\\'s largest oil company. At the same time, Simon said \"U.S. oil production declined by 300,000 bpd, the first decline in several years,\" and \"net petroleum imports were up 25 pct to 5.3 mln bpd.\" Noting that while oil prices were expected to remain between 13 and 20 dlrs a barrel, depending on OPEC\\'s ability to control production, Simon said demand is expected to remain at 1986 levels, leading to \"a significant amount of spare worldwide production capacity, in excess of 10 mln bpd.\" He said the surplus capacity would lead to continued volatility and called for \"governmental and regulatory policies in support of the domestic petroleum industry.\" Citing the costs recently imposed by the federal government through the 1986 tax code changes and \"Superfund\" legislation, Simon called for the repeal of the windfall profits tax, total decontrol of natural gas and improved access to federal lands for oil and gas exploration. Simon did not mention an oil import fee, which many in the industry have called for as a way of building up the nation\\'s domestic operations before imports reach such a level that national security might be compromised. In yesterday\\'s report, the Energy Department said imports could make up 50 pct of U.S. demand by 1995, adding that Persian Gulf producers will provide as much as 65 pct of the free world\\'s total oil consumption by that date. Arguing that \"oil is a political tool in every nation on earth,\" Frank Pitts, chairman of &lt;Pitts Oil Co>, today called for a variable oil import fee, among other measures, \"before the treacherous foothold of the Middle East is irreversible and our national security is compromised.\" Royce Wisenbaker, Chairman of Wisenbaker Production Co, agreed, saying that like many federal government programs that were set up with good intentions, it would probably turn into a \"shambles.\" Wisenbaker added that he was optimistic for the future. \"For those of us who have managed to hold on, the worst is over,\" he said. Roger Hemminghaus, President of Diamond Shamrock Refining and Marketing Co, said he was \"enthusiastic about the future,\" adding that he expected \"an increase in profitability by midyear.\" NE ELECTRIC SEES HIGHER CONSTRUCTION OUTLAYS New England Electric System &lt;NES> expects its cash construction spending to reach 205 mln dlrs this year, up from 188 mln dlrs in 1986, the utility said in material distributed at an analysts meeting. It said spending is expected to advance to 215 mln dlrs in 1988 and 220 mln dlrs in 1989. The utility said these totals exclude spending on New England Hydro-Transmission being built to import electricity from Quebec Hydro. New England Electric is the operator of this venture as well as owning 51 pct of the project. The venture expects to spend 65 mln dlr this year, 105 mln dlrs next year and 125 mln dlrs in 1989 to build transmission lines from northern Quebec into New England, the utility said. New England Electric said internally generated funds will cover all of its power plant construction costs this year and 65 pct of the 108 mln dlrs its retail distribution units plan to spend in 1987. The company said it also expects to spend 60 mln dlrs on its oil and gas activities this year, adding internally generated funds are expected to provide 85 pct of this total. New England Electric said it plans to issue 30 mln dlrs worth of pollution control bonds in 1987 and retire additional higher cost preferred stock. Its Granite State Electric unit plans to issue five mln dlrs of long term notes early this year as well. The company said it does not plan to offer common shares this year or in the foreseeable future, but expects to raise about 40 mln dlrs in equity through the sale of stock under its dividend reinvestment plan and employee share plans. President Samuel Huntington told the analysts the construction spending projection is based on the expectation that demand for electricity in the New England electric system will grow about two pct a year for the next 15 years. However, the utility cannot ignore the potential for sharper growth, he said, pointing out that demand was up 5.2 pct in 1986 and 4.7 pct per year in the past four years. He attributed this growth to declining electricity prices and a strong New England economy. Huntington said New England Elecetric has \"all but rejected new coal fired plants\" to supply additional power. He said the most attractive new power supplies are those with short lead times which can be built in modules. Later, vice president Glenn Schleede said the utility is looking at gas-fired, combined cycle generating units to supply most of its new power needs, but has not rejected coal-fired fluidized bed units. He explained that fluidized bed technology is available in modular units, adding that Huntington was referring to the traditional coal-fired plant which burns pulverized coal. DOE SECRETARY PROPOSES OIL TAX INCENTIVES Energy Secretary John Herrington said he will propose tax incentives to increase domestic oil and natural gas exploration and production to the Reagan Administration for consideration. \"These options boost production, while avoiding the huge costs associated with proposals like an oil import fee,\" Herrington told a House Energy subcommittee hearing. \"It is my intention to submit these proposals to the domestic policy council and the cabinet for consideration and review.\" \"The goal of the Administration policies is to increase domestic production. I would like to shoot for one mln barrels a day,\" he said. The proposals were based on a DOE study released yesterday warning the United States was threatened by a growing dependence on oil imports. \"We project free world dependence on Persian Gulf oil at 65 pct by 1995,\" Herrington said. MEXICAN HYDROCARBON RESERVES FALL SLIGHTLY IN 1986 mexico\\'s proven reserves of liquid hydrocarbons at end-1986 were 70 billion barrels, slightly down from 70.9 billion a year ago and 71.75 billion in 1984, the state oil company petroleos mexicanos (pemex) announced. Reserves were just 5.77 billion barrels in 1974, rose sharply to 40.19 billion in 1978 and flattened out at 72 billion in both 1981 and 1982. In its annual report, pemex said average crude output in 1986 was 2.43 mln barrels per day, 202,000 bpd down on 1985. Average exports were 1.29 mln bpd, down from 1.44 mln bpd. The company did not say what percentage of hydrocarbons was crude oil, but has previouly said it was about 48 pct. Natural gas output in 1986 was 3.43 billion cubic feet per day, down from 3.6 billion in 1985. Due mainly to the fall in oil prices to around 12 dlrs from 25 dlrs in the year, 58 wells, both exploratory and production, were suspended, 38 of them in less productive areas than the offshore campeche fields which accounted for 64 pct of production. NO IMMEDIATE PLANS TO CLOSE REFINERY - ESSO SAF ESSO SAF &lt;ESSF.PA>, the French subsidiary of Exxon Corp &lt;XON>, said it had no immediate plans to shut down one of its two refineries. Exxon\\'s new president Lee R. Raymond said earlier that it could decide to close a French refinery. An ESSO SAF spokesman said a closure was a hypothesis that depended on the evolution of the market and refineries\\' ability to make money. He said Port Jerome west of Paris and Fos sur Mer on the Mediterranean had benefitted from new investment over 1985-86 and had last year broken even after stock losses. The Port Jerome refinery has an annual production capacity of seven mln tonnes while Fos sur Mer\\'s is five mln, the spokesman added. Industry sources said the easiest plant to dispose of would be Fos sur Mer because it is a single refinery, while the Port Jerome refinery is attached to a wider complex comprising a petrochemical plant and a lubricant production plant. Raymond was quoted as saying in a published interview that Exxon was reviewing its worldwide refinery operations and might decide to close one of its French refineries. EIA SAYS DISTILLATES OFF 7.6 MLN BBLS, GASOLINE OFF 3.4 MLN, CRUDE OFF 4.4 MLN EIA SAYS DISTILLATES OFF 7.6 MLN BBLS, GASOLINE OFF 3.4 MLN, CRUDE OFF 4.4 MLN DIVISION SEEN ON HOW TO HELP U.S. OIL INDUSTRY The U.S. Congress and the oil industry are deeply divided on ways the government should assist the industry, hurt by the sharp fall in oil prices, and the subsequent growth in oil imports, industry analysts said. \"The industry is deeply divided between those who support an oil tariff and those who believe tax incentives are better,\" said Daniel Yergin, director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, which recently completed a survey of the U.S. Congress on energy issues. Yergin said he saw mounting support within Congress for tax incentives rather than an oil tariff or import fee. Today U.S. Energy Secretary John Herington said he will propose tax incentives to increase edomestic oil and natural gas exploration and production to the Reagan Administration for consideration. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the proposal would be reviewed. Herrington said, \"I would like to shoot for one mln barrels a day (addition) to U.S. production.\" U.S. oil output was off to 8.4 mln bpd in the week of March 13, down six pct from last year, the American Petroleum Institute said. Oil industry analysts have forecast oil prices to average about 18 dlrs a barrel for the year and many believe that a move above that level will be unlikey for the near term. Paul Mlotok, oil analyst for Salomon Brothers Inc said that \"even with the rise in prices for the last week or two we\\'ve only altered our average price scenerio to about 17.50 dlrs for the year.\" Analysts said that at that price renewed drilling and exploration to reverse the decline in U.S. crude oil output will not take place as the companies are waiting for stable prices over 20 dlrs to renew exploration. John Lichtblau, president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation Inc in New york in recent testimony to Congress said \"The continuing decline in U.S. oil production is virtually inevitable under any realistic price scenario. But the future rate of decline is very much a function of world oil prices and U.S. government policy.\" Lichtbalu said that tax breaks could be used to raise oil production but would only work over time. \"Lowering the producing industry\\'s tax burden would probably be a slower stimulant (to output) than a price increase but would not raise energy costs.\" Lichtblau said. But the small independent oil companies who do much of the drilling in the U.S. are looking for the more immediate relief which could be brought on by an oil import fee. Ronald Tappmeyer, president of the International Association of Drilling Contractors, said, \"The members of our trade asssociation are convinced that only a variable oil import fee that sets a minimum price trigger can protect our nation.\" The association represents some 1,300 drilling and oil service companies. The CERA survey of Congress shows that the oil import fee will face a stiff uphill battle. Yergin said that the poll which was conducted in January by a former Congressman, Orval Hansen, showed support for the oil import fee from 22 pct of the Congressmen surveyed largely as a means of protecting the domestic petroleum industry. At the same time 48 pct of the Congressmen surveyed opposed the fee with the respondents saying the tariff would hurt consumers and some regional interests. But 80 pct of the sample said support for a fee could grow if production continued to fall and imports to rise. Yergin said that imports above 50 pct of U.S. requirements \"is a critical, symbolic level. If they (imports) move above that level, a fee may not be legislated but there will certainly be pressure for some form of action.\" But Lichtblau, in a telephone interview, said, \"a 50 pct rate of import dependency is not likely to happen before 1990. In 1986 U.S. oil imports rose to 33 pct of u.s. energy requirements and shopuld be about 34 pct in 1987, he added. RECENT U.S. OIL DEMAND UP 2.3 PCT FROM YEAR AGO U.S. oil demand as measured by products supplied rose 2.3 pct in the four weeks ended March 13 to 16.49 mln barrels per day (bpd) from 16.11 mln in the same period a year ago, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) said. In its weekly petroleum status report, the Energy Department agency said distillate demand was up 2.9 pct in the period to 3.43 mln bpd from 3.33 mln a year earlier. Gasoline demand averaged 6.93 mln bpd, up 4.0 pct from 6.67 mln last year, while residual fuel demand was 1.31 mln bpd, off 7.9 pct from 1.42 mln, the EIA said. Domestic crude oil production was estimated at 8.36 mln bpd, down 8.1 pct from 9.10 mln a year ago, and gross daily crude imports (excluding those for the SPR) averaged 3.70 mln bpd, up 24.8 pct from 2.96 mln, the EIA said. Refinery crude runs in the four weeks were 11.92 mln bpd, up 1.0 pct from 11.80 mln a year earlier, it said. Year-to-date figures will not become available until March 26 when EIA\\'s Petroleum Supply Monthly data for January 1987 becomes available, the agency said. ARGENTINE OIL, GAS PRODUCTION FALL IN FEBRUARY Argentina\\'s total oil and gas production fell 9.4 pct in February to 2.78 mln cubic metres from January\\'s total of 3.11 mln cubic metres, the state oil company Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales (YPF) reported. A YPF statement blamed the drop on momentary problems owing to the summer season but gave no further details. February\\'s production figure fell slightly short of YPF\\'s target figure of 2.90 mln cubic metres. Oil production totalled 1.76 mln cubic metres last month and natural gas production 1.02 mln cubic metres, down from 1.95 and 1.15 mln cubic metres in January, respectively. CANTERRA ENERGY TO DRILL WELL OFF NOVA SCOTIA &lt;Canterra Energy Ltd> said it will drill an exploratory well on the Scotian shelf, about 280 kilometers east-southeast of Halifax, Nova Scotia. Drilling will begin in late April 1987 in 61 meters of water and will be drilled to a total depth of 3,500 meters, Canterra said. Canterra will operate the well and has a 39 pct interest in it. &lt;Petro-Canada Inc> has 26 pct, &lt;Trillium Exploration Corp> has 20 pct and &lt;Nova Scotia Resources (Ventures) Ltd> has 15 pct. ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - SAUDI ARABIA RESHAPES ECONOMY Higher world oil prices, coupled with a new realism ushered in by austerity, could lift Saudi Arabia\\'s economy after five years of falling revenue and growing budget deficits, bankers and diplomats said. The months ahead will prove critical as the government attempts a balancing act between defending higher oil prices and fostering recovery through a bigger role for the private sector. Economists said oil earnings could recover this year to about 20 billion dlrs and nominal gross domestic product could grow by about three pct, the first rise since 1982. But the economists said this will be possible only if the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) succeeds in defending world oil prices and if Saudi Arabia is not forced to curtail output for too long. Saudi Arabia is now keeping production down to defend OPEC\\'s newly-established 18 dlr a barrel benchmark price. Oil Minister Hisham Nazer told Reuters output is running at about three mln barrels per day (bpd), well down on Saudi Arabia\\'s OPEC quota of 4.13 mln set for the first half of 1987. King Fahd has stamped his personal authority on OPEC\\'s new-found determination to defend prices in a move Western diplomats believe underlines the kingdom\\'s need to secure a stable source of income for its economy. Saudi Arabia, still the world\\'s largest oil exporter, is a hugely wealthy country. But the past five years of declining revenue have taken their toll. Economists estimate gross domestic product fell 10 pct last year and 8.6 pct in 1985. Oil revenue last year, when prices briefly dipped below 10 dlrs per barrel, probably totalled no more than 17.5 billion dlrs, compared to a peak 101.8 billion in 1981. \"Austerity is still the watchword, but Saudi Arabia will not be allowed to dip further into recession ... The Saudis can afford to draw down reserves temporarily to offset the worst effects,\" a diplomat said. In the short-term, the kingdom can lessen the impact of lower oil revenues and a gaping budget deficit by drawing on foreign reserves, still put at around 100 billion dlrs. But such a policy cannot be pursued indefinitely. Bankers and diplomats said it would amount to fiscal recklessness in the longer term. It also increases the dominance of the public sector at a time when the government is publicly urging private enterprise to take over the lead role in the economy. Bankers and diplomats said the government is well aware of the risks attached to this policy but is determined to \"tough it out\" on the oil front even if that means a short-term depletion of reserves. The 1987 budget deficit is targetted at a huge 52.7 billion riyals or 31 pct of total outlay. The budget explicitly recognises the need to draw down reserves while foreign borrowing has been ruled out. Commerce Minister Suleiman Abdulaziz al-Salim told Saudi businessmen this week the government had carefully considered the need to stimulate the economy when drawing up its budget plans late last year. \"It therefore took the bold step of withdrawing more than 50 billion riyals from its reserves and pumping it into the economy,\" he said. Reserves were built up during the late 1970\\'s and early 1980\\'s when Saudi Arabia\\'s breakneck pace of construction and tales of high spending became legendary. The shrinking economy has wrought huge changes in the fabric of the Kingdom\\'s private sector where poor management had gone unpunished in the easy days of the oil boom. Modern techniques of cost control have been introduced, markets expanded and outsized labour forces and inventories cut back. The expatriate workforce has fallen sharply. The number of new bankruptcies appears to be declining but Saudi banks, hit hard by non-performing loans to the corporate sector, have become highly selective in extending new credit. Government moves to encourage lending and investigate company complaints about late public sector contract payments could boost confidence but recession has slowed the nation\\'s industrialisation program and discouraged foreign investment. Private wealth is still very high and banks report more and more cash being placed on deposit. As Saudi Arabia attempts to shift the weight of economic development from the public to the private sector, one of the biggest tasks will be to convince businessmen to channel personal savings into industrial projects within the kingdom and refrain from the temptation to invest abroad. NYMEX WILL EXPAND OFF-HOUR TRADING APRIL ONE The New York Mercantile Exchange set April one for the debut of a new procedure in the energy complex that will increase the use of energy futures worldwide. On April one, NYMEX will allow oil traders that do not hold a futures position to initiate, after the exchange closes, a transaction that can subsequently be hedged in the futures market, according to an exchange spokeswoman. \"This will change the way oil is transacted in the real world,\" said said Thomas McKiernan, McKiernan and Co chairman. Foreign traders will be able to hedge trades against NYMEX prices before the exchange opens and negotiate prices at a differential to NYMEX prices, McKiernan explained. The expanded program \"will serve the industry because the oil market does not close when NYMEX does,\" said Frank Capozza, secretary of Century Resources Inc. The rule change, which has already taken effect for platinum futures on NYMEX, is expected to increase the open interest and liquidity in U.S. energy futures, according to traders and analysts. Currently, at least one trader in this transaction, called an exchange for physical or EFP, must hold a futures position before entering into the transaction. Under the new arrangement, neither party has to hold a futures position before entering into an EFP and one or both parties can offset their cash transaction with a futures contract the next day, according to exchange officials. When NYMEX announced its proposed rule change in December, NYMEX President Rosemary McFadden, said, \"Expansion of the EFP provision will add to globalization of the energy markets by providing for, in effect, 24-hour trading.\" The Commodity Futures Trading Commission approved the rule change in February, according to a CFTC spokeswoman. CANADIAN ROXY IN NEW ALBERTA OIL DISCOVERY &lt;Canadian Roxy Petroleum Ltd> said a new oil discovery in the Peerless Lake area of north-central Alberta is capable of flowing at over 1,000 barrels of oil a day from a lower zone and more than 1,500 barrels a day from a separate upper zone. Canadian Roxy has a 35 pct interest in the five-year royalty free well, known as the Canadian Roxy et Al Trout A14-8-89-3 W5M. Texaco Canada Inc holds 25 pct, MLC Oil and Gas Ltd 15 pct, Northstar Energy Corp 13.5 pct and Tricentrol Oils Ltd 11.5 pct. Canadian Roxy said drilling has started on a follow-up exploratory well about one mile northwest of the discovery well. The company said it holds a net 6,500 acres in the vicinity of the discovery and a seismic program is underway to evaluate further drilling opportunities. ARGENTINE OIL PRODUCTION DOWN IN JANUARY 1987 Argentine crude oil production was down 10.8 pct in January 1987 to 12.32 mln barrels, from 13.81 mln barrels in January 1986, Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales said. January 1987 natural gas output totalled 1.15 billion cubic metrers, 3.6 pct higher than 1.11 billion cubic metres produced in January 1986, Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales added. U.S. ENERGY CHIEF SEES PROMISE IN OIL-TAX CHANGE Energy Secretary John Herrington said his proposed option to raise the oil depletion allowance to 27.5 pct was probably the most economically promising way to spur domestic production. The White House has said it would consider the option although it was generally opposed to any revisions in the new tax code. Herrington told a meeting of the Mid-Continent Oil and Gas Association that the higher depletion allowance on new oil and enhanced oil recovery would cost taxpayers about 200 mln dlrs a year. The option was one of many contained in a report on oil and the national security the Energy Department sent to the White House on Tuesday. Herrington said of the increased depletion allowance option: \"that is one that could significantly increase production at a very low cost to the American taxpayer.\" He again rejected an oil import fee as far too costly to the overall U.S. economy. U.S. ENERGY SECRETARY RULES OUT GASOLINE TAX Energy Secretary John Herrington said he would rule out a tax on gasoline as one option to help avert what his departmet has called the threat of increased reliance on foreign oil in the coming years. He said at a news conference that any recommendation he would make would have to increase domestic production, not cause widespread economic hardship and have a minimal cost to the U.S. taxpayer. On the grounds of increasing production, he said, \"I would rule out a gasoline tax.\" Herrington also repeated he would rule out an oil import fee because of the widespread dislocation it would cause -- the loss of about 400,000 jobs nationwide due to higher oil prices and a drop in the gross national product by about 32 billion dlrs. He said an increased depletion allowance, to 27.5 pct, on new and enhanced production of oil and natural gas would be a cheap way to spur domestic production. He estimated this cost at about 200 mln dlrs a year. Herrington proposed the increased depletion allowance to the White House Tuesday but the White House reaction was cool. The White House said it would study the proposal, but was generally oppposed to altering the national tax code, just passed last year. Herrington, asked his reaction to the White House reaction, said, \"If I were the White House, I would be cool, too.\" U.S. ENERGY CHIEF RULES OUT GASOLINE TAX AS WAY TO AVERT PENDING OIL CRISIS U.S. ENERGY CHIEF RULES OUT GASOLINE TAX AS WAY TO AVERT PENDING OIL CRISIS BRITOIL SEES LOWER U.K. EXPLORATION EXPENDITURE Britoil Plc\\'s &lt;BTOL.L> exploration expenditure for the U.K. In 1987 was likely to be only about a third of the level in 1986, though overseas expenditure would remain approximately the same, Chief executive David Walker said. He told reporters following the release of the company\\'s 1986 figures that project expenditure would also remain at 1986 levels. U.K. Project expenditure in 1986 rose to 208 mln stg from 184 mln while exploration expenditure dropped to 87 mln from 156 mln. Overseas exploration fell to 28 mln from 58 mln in 1985. Earlier, Britoil posted a drop in pretax profit for 1986 to 134 mln stg from 759 mln in 1985, before an extraordinary charge of 50 mln stg on the company\\'s U.S. Assets. The results were slightly better than analysts forecast and the share firmed to 231p from 222p at last night\\'s close. Chairman Sir Philip Shelbourne said the collapse in the oil price in 1986 had made the period extremely difficult but the company had come through remarkably well. Provided the recovery in oil prices was maintained, the conditions would be right for a substantially improved performance this year. He added that the firmness of oil prices in March, when they were normally weaker, made him \"a bit encouraged\" about the prospects for future levels. Walker added that Britoil would feel confident if the price stayed within a band of 15 dlrs to 20 dlrs a barrel. Britoil had received some 100 responses to its announcement of a desire to sell the assets and was asking for bids by the latter part of April. End-year reserves rose to 603 mln barrels of oil compared with 503 mln previously. However, Walker noted that this included a revised definition of reserves. If 1985 figures were restated along the same lines, the reserve figure would show a drop from 720 mln barrels previously. Gas reserves also eased to 3,568 billion cubic feet from a restated 3,660 billion. API SAYS U.S. CRUDE OIL OUPUT OFF FROM YEAR AGO The American Petroleum Institute said that U.S. crude oil production in February declined 9.8 pct from year-ago levels to about 8.3 mln barrels a day. In its monthly report on U.S. oil supplies and stocks, API said that domestic demand for petroleum products, as measured by products supplied, continued to rise reaching 16.3 mln barrels a day in the month, up 1.5 pct from February 1986. API noted the drop in crude oil output coupled with a drop in natural gas liquids production, which was off 11 pct from February 1986 levels, represented a decline in U.S. production of more than one mln barrels a day. API said the decline in domestic production and the rise in demand brought petroleum imports to about six mln barrels a day in February, a 30.3 pct increase from last year\\'s level. So far this year, API said growth in domestic demand, which was up 2.9 pct from last year\\'s year-to-date level, has slowed in comparison to the accelerated growth in the last half of 1986. It said crude oil production for the first two months of 1987 was off 8.6 pct from the comparable year-ago period while crude imports were up 30.6 pct. UK CROSS FIELD PRT RELIEF FAVOURS SMALLER FIELDS The \"cross field allowance\" relief on Petroleum Revenue Tax (PRT) announced by U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson this week will favour smaller non-PRT paying fields, according to stockbrokers Wood Mackenzie and Co. The cross field allowance offsets up to 10 pct of qualifying spending on a new oil field against PRT liability of other fields. It is restricted to new offshore developments outside the southern basin and yet to gain Annex B approval. A report by the stockbrokers said that on a new field not paying PRT due to its small size, the relief would directly benefit in PRT saving on an existing field. \"The cross field allowance will mainly benefit participators in those fields which have no PRT liability,\" the report said, adding that the timing of development of such fields may be advanced. The government would in effect be subsidising these developments at 7.5 pct of capital expenditure before corporation tax, the report said. On fields likely to pay PRT in the future, the benefit is of timing. Although liabilities on other existing fields will be reduced immediately, liabilities on larger new fields will rise in the future due to the loss of offsets, it said. In a study on probable fields, the report said that when the rates of return are examined, the rise for a PRT-paying field such as Miller, the largest undeveloped oil field in the U.K. North Sea, is from 18.7 to 19 pct, while the rise for a small non-PRT paying field such as Kittiwake is 15.9 to 17.9 pct. The report added that in fields which pay PRT, there will be a cost in being able to have this early relief. Not only will these costs be unavailable for offset against the field\\'s future profits, but uplift of some 35 pct on these costs will be lost. Thus, a saving of PRT of 100 when field development starts will have to be matched by a rise in PRT of 135 at a later time. AMOCO &lt;AN> OIL RESERVES DOWN, GAS UP IN 1986 Amoco Corp\\'s petroleum liquids reserves total 2.42 billion barrels at the end of 1986, down from 2.77 billion a year earlier, but its natural gas reserves increased to 15.37 trillion cubic feet from 15.14 trillion, the company\\'s annual report said. It said the drop in crude oil and natural gas liquid reserves reflected downward revisions of previous estimates caused by the sharp drop in oil prices last year. This accounted for 178 mln barrels of a worldwide downward revision of 188 mln barrels, with 158 mln barrels of the total revision occurring in the United States, the report said. Amoco said there were upward revisions in the size of its worldwide gas reserves totalling 404 billion cubic feet last year, while it discovered 568 billion cubic feet and purchased 298 billion cubic feet of reserves. Production of one trillion cubic feet offset much of these gains, the report said. All of the gas reserve purchases, as well as all of the 14 mln barrels of oil reserves bought in 1986, were in the United States, Amoco said, noting it has spent 1.1 billion dlrs to acquire U.S. producing properties over the past three years. Commenting on 1987, Amoco said acquisitions \"will be an integral part of our strategy, should reserves become available at attractive prices.\" The company said it expects \"the marketing climate for natural gas to improve in 1987, which should provide the opportunity for Amoco to expand sales. As prices and demand improve, we are poised to accelerate capital spending on our inventory of attractive opportunities.\" Amoco previously announced a 1987 capital spending budget of 3.2 billion dlrs. Such spending totaled 3.18 billion dlrs last year, down from 5.31 billion in 1985. ECUADOR GETS LOAN TO HELP REPAIR OIL PIPELINE The Andean Development Corp (CAF) said today it is lending 11.7 mln dlrs to Ecuador to help repair 25 miles of oil pipeline destroyed by an earthquake earlier this month. the loan was signed here today in the offices of the caracas based caf by the corporation\\'s president, galo montano perez and ecuadorean ambassador antonio parra gil. the loan had originally been intended to finance an expansion of the pipeline, but following the earthquake the ecuadorean government asked for the terms to be changed so as to permit their use in reconstruction. Ecuador expects oil production to be suspended for four months as a result of the damage, and has asked Venezuela to help by supplying 50,000 barrels per day while the pipeline is repaired. The OPEC member has a production quota of 210,000 bpd but has asked the organization to allow it to produce 310,000 bpd once the repairs are completed so as to compensate the loss. REAGAN SAYS U.S. MUST DO MORE TO LESSEN RELIANCE ON FOREIGN OIL REAGAN SAYS U.S. MUST DO MORE TO LESSEN RELIANCE ON FOREIGN OIL REAGAN SAYS U.S. NEEDS TO LESSEN OIL IMPORTS President Reagan said the United States must do more to lessen its reliance on imported oil. President Reagan said during a nationally televised news conference that the rising U.S. reliance on foreign oil is a problem that the administration is studying. \"We have to study this more,\" Reagan said. \"This is why we increased the Strategic (Petroleum) Reserve, but we have to do more,\" he said. Reagan said his administration has already proposed deregulating natural gas and eliminating the windfall profits tax on crude oil production. However, he complained that Congress had not yet approved those measures. The Department of Energy earlier this week released a report that warned of rising U.S. reliance on foreign oil imports at a time when domestic production is declining. It suggested options for the administration to consider, but made no specific recommendations.

TRICO &lt;TRO> GETS CHINESE CONTRACT Trico Industries Inc said it has received a six mln dlr contract to supply hydraulic lift equipment for heavy crude oil production for the Chinese Ministry of Petroleum Industry. The company said the equipment is for use in the Laiohe oilfield 350 miles northeast of Peking and will equip a 140-well program. CANADA NORTHWEST TO SELL PREFERRED SHARES &lt;Canada Northwest Energy Ltd> said it reached agreement in principle to sell one mln preferred shares by way of private placement to raise 32.5 mln dlrs for oil and gas exploration. The 5.4 pct cumulative redeemable convertible series D preferred shares will be flow-through shares entitling holders to tax deductions not claimed by the company. The shares will be convertible anytime after issue into common shares at an equivalent conversion price of 32.50 dlrs a share. After one year, they will be redeemable at any time by the company at 25 dlrs a share plus accrued dividends. GULF CANADA &lt;GOC> ASSERTS NO DAMAGE FROM SPILL Gulf Canada Corp said a discharge of material at its Amauligak drilling site in the Beaufort Sea caused no danger to the environment. Yesterday, the federal department of energy charged Gulf Canada with eight counts of illegal dumping for discharging powdered cement and drilling mud between September 23 and 30 last year. The charges carry a maximum 50,000 dlr fine on each count. Gulf said the government\\'s charges relate to discharging materials without a permit, not to environmental damage resulting from the action. Gulf said it voluntarily informed appropriate government officials when the material was discharged. The company also said none of the material was discharged within 12 miles of the closest shoreline. It added that one of the materials cited, barite, is a naturally occurring mineral routinely discharged into the sea during drilling operations. TALKING POINT/FIRST CITY BANCORPORATION &lt;FBT> First City Bancorporation\\'s sale of 54 mln dlrs in oil loans to Prudential-Bache should significantly reduce its energy problems, but the bank\\'s losses are still virtually guaranteed to continue, analysts said. The package of energy loans was sold at book value, so First City did not to show a gain or loss, said bank spokesman James Day. He added it was possible First City would sell more of the bank\\'s remaining 1.4 billion dlrs in oil-related loans to raise cash. The loans had been made by First City to oil producers and to oilfield service and supply companies. Day said some had already been classified as nonperforming, or charged off as a loss, but he could not identify how many were included in those categories. The loans were purchased by Prudential Bache\\'s Energy Growth Fund, a limited partnership created last month with 90 mln dlrs in funding to invest in oil and gas properties. First City, the big Texas bank hit hardest by the downturn in oil prices, lost a record 402 mln dlrs in fiscal year 1986 and has said it is seeking a merger partner or some other capital assistance. The Houston-based bank\\'s nonperforming assets totaled 897.1 mln dlrs at yearend, up from 563.1 mln dlrs at the end of 1985 Analysts have said no buyer is likely to be interested in the troubled bank unless government assistance is available. \"Their problems are not just limited to energy. They have a substantial portfolio in real estate. This sale in and of itself won\\'t make the company look better to a potential buyer,\" said Ray Archibold, a banking analyst with McCarthy, Crisanti and Maffei Inc. \"It does reduce the bank\\'s exposure in energy loans and 54 mln dlrs is a substantial amount,\" Archibold said, \"but the deal represents only about four pct of their energy loans.\" Of First City\\'s total loan portfolio of 9.9 mln dlrs, about 14 pct or 1.4 billion dlrs were made to energy producers or suppliers, analysts said. Its record losses have been caused by its past status as one of the nation\\'s top lenders to oil and gas producers and suppliers during the boom days of the late 1970s and early 1980s. First City said about half of the loans sold to Prudential came from its Energy Finance Co., an entity formed in 1982 to loan money to \"more venturesome\" oil borrowers that promised a higher potential return. The other half of the loans were from First City\\'s lead bank in Houston. Chris Kotowski, an analyst with Oppenheimer and Co., said the sale of the package of energy loans was the first encouraging news from First City in months. \"It\\'s not going to solve all of First City\\'s problems but it\\'s a good transaction for them. It may be possible for them to sell additional loans,\" Kotowski said. \"Prudential can fund these things more cheaply than First City and there\\'s an incentive to invest in troubled energy companies right now as values are depressed\" In a statement, First City chairman J.A. Elkins said the bank\\'s strategy was to reduce the proportion of energy loans to total loans. \"This move, which we believe is the first transaction of its kind, helps us further, and we were able to make it without suffering a loss.\" FTC URGES VETO OF GEORGIA GASOLINE STATION BILL The Federal Trade Commission said its staff has urged the governor of Georgia to veto a bill that would prohibit petroleum refiners from owning and operating retail gasoline stations. The proposed legislation is aimed at preventing large oil refiners and marketers from using predatory or monopolistic practices against franchised dealers. But the FTC said fears of refiner-owned stations as part of a scheme of predatory or monopolistic practices are unfounded. It called the bill anticompetitive and warned that it would force higher gasoline prices for Georgia motorists. NYMEX RULE CHANGE SEEN BOOSTING ENERGY TRADE The New York Mercantile Exchange said it will introduce exchanges for physicals (EFPS) to its energy futures markets April one. An exchange spokeswoman said the change will allow oil traders that do not hold a futures position to initiate, after the exchange closes, a transaction that can subsequently be hedged in the futures market. EFPs, already in effect for platinum futures on NYMEX, are expected to increase the open interest and liquidity in U.S. energy futures, according to traders and analysts. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission approved the rule change in February, according to a CFTC spokeswoman. BIDS AWARDED FOR ELK HILLS CRUDE OIL The U.S. Department of Energy said it has awarded bids for about 90,000 barrels per day, bpd, of crude oil from the Elk Hills Naval Petroleum Reserve in California. The contract period runs from April one through July one, the DOE said. Successful bidders, the amount of crude oil and the price per bbl according to the DOE are as follows - Texaco Inc\\'s &lt;TX> Texaco Trading and Transport 15,000 bpd at 15.79 dlrs and 2,200 bpd at 15.19 dlrs, Beacon Oil Co 7,000 bpd at 15.66 dlrs and 2,500 bpd at 16.04 dlrs, Golden West Refining 8,110 bpd at 15.42 dlrs. Successful bidders, the amount of oil and price per bbl, according to the DOE continue as follows - Chevron\\'s &lt;CHV> Chevron USA Inc 3,000 bpd at 14.51 dlrs and 4,000 bpd at 14.61 dlrs, Chevron International Oil Co 2,600 bpd at 14.41 dlrs and 2,800 bpd at 14.51 dlrs, Newhall Refining Co 6,000 bpd at 15.82 dlrs, Caljet Inc 4,000 bpd at 15.32 dlrs, Casey Co 4,000 bpd at 15.45 dlrs. Also, Cryssen Refining Inc 4,000 bpd at 15.47 dlrs, Edgington Oil Co 4,000 bpd at 15.54 dlrs, Sound Refining Inc 3,100 bpd at 15.51 dlrs, Atlantic Richfield Co &lt;ARC> 3,000 bpd at 15.75 dlrs. Successful bidders, the amount of crude oil and the price per bbl according to the DOE continue as follows - Orkin Inc 2,679 bpd at 15.24 dlrs, Lunday-Thagard Co 2,511 bpd at 15.27 dlrs, Golden Eagle Refining 2,500 bpd at 15.37 dlrs, MacMillan Ring-Free Oil Co 1,000 bpd at 15.81 dlrs, 1,000 bpd at 15.71 dlrs and 230 bpd at 16.02 dlrs, Mock Resources 2,000 bpd at 15.76 dlrs, Petro-Diamond 2,000 bpd at 15.46 dlrs. NATURAL GAS SEEN RECAPTURING SOME MARKET SHARE Higher crude oil prices will raise demand for natural gas, helping it to reclaim market share lost to heavy oil when prices plunged in 1986, analysts said. The analysts said that these efforts will be most successful in the industrial sectors of the economy with large and growing energy requirements. \"Natural gas stands a good chance to recapture the share of oil supplied to electric utilities that it lost to the residual fuel industry last year,\" Michael Smolinski, an energy economist with Data Resources Inc, told Reuters. An estimated 200,000 barrels per day of residual fuel went into the utilities market at the expense of natural gas last year when world oil prices plunged, Smolinski said. Assuming oil prices hold above 15 dlrs a barrel, national average gas prices delivered to the utilities at a projected 2.10 to 2.25 dlrs per mln Btu would be very competitive, Michael German, vice president of economic analysis at American Gas Association said. The average delivered prices at the end of January were 2.10 dlrs per mln Btu, compared with 3.26 dlrs a year ago. \"We expect natural gas to regain 250 to 400 billion cubic feet (of demand) in the overall energy market in the second and third quarter (1987),\" he said. In addition to price competitiveness, availability will be an important factor persuading energy users to switch to gas, Frank Spadine, senior energy economist with Bankers Trust Corp. in New York noted. Spadine said the mild winter in many parts of the North American continent has led to a build up of gas inventories and less would be necessary to replenish underground storage this spring freeing gas for spot sales. These forecasts develop a strong counterpoint to the fears that natural gas suplies would be tight and prices significantly higher given a sharp decline in drilling last year. AGA\\'s German contended that despite the drilling decline, much of U.S. proved reserves could be brought to production quickly through developments such as the infill drilling which permits more wells to be drilled in proved reserve basins. Citing recent EIA statistics, German said, the gas surplus was likely to contract from three trillion cubic feet in 1986 to two trillion cubic feet in 1987, but the surplus would not go away until 1990. Smolinski of Data Resources agreed that the surplus would persist until 1990. While gas supplies may tighten in certain consuming areas, notably in California and in the Northeast U.S., an overall shortfall appeared remote. WORLD BANK LIKELY TO URGE CHANGES ON JAKARTA World Bank President Barber Conable is expected to press Indonesia, the Third World\\'s sixth largest debtor, to maintain the momentum of economic policy changes to tackle the slump in its oil revenues, western diplomats said. Conable, who flew to Indonesia yesterday from Tokyo, will meet with President Suharto and senior economic ministers. He said on arrival that the economy of South-East Asia\\'s largest nation was being managed well, but the slump in world oil prices called for major policy adjustments. Today the World Bank chief will visit Bank-funded projects in the eastern section of Java, Indonesia\\'s most populous island. He will see Suharto on Tuesday after a day of detailed discussions with ministers tomorrow. Indonesia, the only Asian member of OPEC, has been severely hit by last year\\'s crash in oil prices, which cut its oil and gas revenues in half. Japan\\'s state Export-Import Bank last month agreed to provide around 900 mln dlrs in untied credits to help Indonesia pay for its share of 21 World Bank development projects. Indonesia, a country of 168 mln people, has responded to the oil slump by cutting spending, devaluing its currency by 31 pct, and trying to boost exports, while using foreign loans to bridge its deficit. Diplomats said that Conable was expected to press Suharto and leading economic ministers to maintain the pace of policy change, particularly in dismantling Indonesia\\'s high-cost protected economy. \"Oil prices, the debt crisis, the world recession, all call for major policy adjustments and external support,\" Conable said in his arrival statement. But with Indonesia facing parliamentary elections next month, he is likely to avoid anything which would imply that the Bank is demanding specific changes. \"We believe there has been wise leadership here and the economy is being very well managed,\" Conable told reporters at Jakarta airport. Indonesia has official and private overseas debts totalling 37 billion dlrs, according to the Bank, which makes it the Third World\\'s sixth biggest debtor. It has received 10.7 billion dlrs from the World Bank since 1968. Conable did not spell out what further changes he would like to see. Last month the Bank endorsed economic changes already introduced by Indonesia, but implied it wanted more. Giving a 300 mln dlr loan in balance of payments support, the Bank said it will monitor progress on implementation of the government\\'s trade reform measures, and supported its determination to promote efficiency and longer-term growth. Indonesia has introduced a series of measures since last May to boost non-oil exports, liberalise trade and encourage outside investment. Suharto has also ordered a government committee to look into which of Indonesia\\'s 215 state-run companies could be sold. But in a report last month, the U.S. Embassy said the government appeared divided over how far to take its reforms. Western analysts say that in particular the government is unsure how far to go with dismantling Indonesia\\'s high-cost monopolies, which control core areas of the economy. Central bank governor Arifin Siregar said this week that Indonesia faced very limited economic choices. It could not spend its way out of trouble because this would increase the balance of payments deficit and domestic inflation. He said the main objective was to raise exports outside the oil and natural gas sector. Indonesia\\'s current account deficit is projected by the government to fall to 2.64 billion dlrs in the coming financial year which starts on April 1, from an estimated 4.1 billion in 1986/87. EXPLOSION AT BP OIL REFINERY IN SCOTLAND An explosion followed by a fire ripped through a British Petroleum (BP) oil refinery, killing one man. A BP spokesman said the fire was confined to one plant at the 700-acre refinery at Grangemouth, 25 miles west of Edinburgh. The cause and extent of the damage had yet to be determined. Two people were killed in a previous explosion and fire at the plant on March 13. That incident is still being investigated, the spokesman said. SANTOS BIDS FOR OIL AND GAS COMPANY TMOC RESOURCES Cooper Basin oil producer Santos Ltd &lt;STOS.S> said it will bid 4.00 dlrs a share for the 96.03 pct it does not already hold in diversified oil and gas company &lt;TMOC Resources Ltd>. Santos said the bid values TMOC at 248.5 mln dlrs. It said it already holds 1.91 mln of TMOC\\'s 25 cent par shares. TMOC held interests outside the Cooper Basin region of South Australia and Queensland and the acquisition would further the Santos objective of developing as a broadly based oil and gas company with interests outside its existing base in the Cooper Basin, the company said in a statement. Santos said TMOC holds several important domestic oil and gas production, exploration and pipeline interests. In the Northern Territory it has a 43.75 pct stake in and operates the Mereenie oil and gas field in the Amadeus Basin and owns 32 pct of &lt;N.T. Gas Pty Ltd>, owner and operator of the Alice Springs to Darwin gas pipeline. In Queensland, TMOC has extensive interests in the Surat Basin, including the 100 pct owned and operated Moonie oil field and 33 pct of the Boxleigh gas field. TMOC owns 80 pct of the &lt;Moonie Pipeline Co Pty Ltd> which owns and operates the Moonie to Brisbane oil pipeline. TMOC also holds 25 pct of the Jackson to Moonie oil pipeline, 20 pct owned by Santos. Output from the Naccowlah block, 40 pct owned by Santos, provides the bulk of the throughput of both pipelines. TMOC has exploration interests in a number of areas in the Amadeus, Surat, Eromanga and Canning basins. It also has oil and gas interests in Britain\\'s North Sea, Ecuador, and the U.S., Along with gold and base metal production through its associate &lt;Paringa Mining and Exploration Co Plc>, Santos said. AUSTRALIA SAID TO RELY TOO MUCH ON OIL TAXES The government\\'s over-reliance on revenue from crude oil is adversely affecting Australia\\'s economic performance, Australian Petroleum Exploration Association (APEA) chairman Dennis Benbow said. Over one-third of Australia\\'s indirect tax income is derived from oil at a time of falling domestic output and weak crude prices, he told the APEA annual conference here. This dependence on oil-generated revenue distorts the country\\'s economic performance directly by acting as a disincentive to new exploration and indirectly by affecting trading competitiveness through high energy costs, he said. Australia\\'s medium-term liquid fuel self-sufficiency position is posing a major economic threat, yet the government\\'s response has been to load new tax burdens on the oil industry, Benbow said. Domestic oil output from existing fields is expected to fall to 280,000 barrels per day (bpd) in fiscal 1992/93 from 546,000 bpd in 1985/86, reflecting mainly the decline of the Bass Strait fields, he said. Bass Strait reserves are now two-thirds depleted, with the three largest fields 80 pct depleted, he said. By 1992/93, Bass Strait output is expected to be just over half the 1985/86 level, assuming a number of so far undeveloped fields are brought on stream and enhanced recovery from existing fields goes ahead, Benbow said. Government projections of output from as yet undiscovered fields range from 40,000 to 130,000 bpd, he said. Australian liquid fuel demand is forecast to rise to 680,000 bpd in 1992/93 from 565,000 in 1985/86, implying a crude oil gap of between 270,000 and 360,000 bpd in five years time, he said. At present world oil prices and the current value of the Australian dollar, annual oil imports in 1992/93 would cost between 3.2 billion and 3.6 billion dlrs, Benbow said. Despite intensive exploration in the early 1980\\'s, the addition to reserves has been inadequate, he said. For example, the 409 mln barrels discovered in the five years 1980-84 represent about two years\\' consumption, he said. He called on the government to review its tax policies to restore incentive to exploration. EXXON OFFICIAL URGES PLANNING FOR NEXT OIL SURGE World governments should prepare for an inevitable significant increase in the price of oil as non-Middle East supplies diminish, Exxon Corp &lt;XON> director and senior vice-president Donald McIvor said. Policymakers must also face up to the reality that the bulk of world oil reserves lies in the Middle East, he said in a speech prepared for delivery to the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association (APEA) annual conference. It appears ever more likely that new discoveries elsewhere will not change this fact, he said. McIvor said 37 of the world\\'s 30,000 oil fields contain about 35 pct of all oil ever discovered. Only 11 of these 37 super-giant fields lie outside the Middle East and only five of the 37 have been discovered in the last 20 years, three of them in the Middle East, he said. He also said that since 1970, the world has been consuming 20 to 25 billion barrels a year while making discoveries at the rate of only 10 to 15 billion barrels a year. More than half of remaining proved reserves are in the Middle East, he said. McIvor said it was important to continue to search for oil outside the Middle East because each addition contributes to a diversity of supply desirable for global political and economic stability. \"It is important to enhance the likelihood of home-country discoveries with measures such as non-discriminatory and stable taxation, and minimum regulation, together with opening up of acreage for exploration,\" he said. Increasing reliance on the Middle East will also boost the incentive to use natural gas and synthetic sources of petroleum, he added. AUSTRALIAN OIL TAX CUT SEEN BOOSTING OUTPUT A 10 percentage point reduction in the Australian government\\'s maximum crude oil levy on old oil would stabilize Bass Straits oil output, resources analyst Ian Story said here. A reduction to 70 pct from 80 pct would enable Bass Strait output to be maintained at the current rate of 420,000 barrels per day (BPD) for the next year rather than falling to 380,000 BPD in 1987/88, he told the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association annual conference. Story is an analyst with and a director of Sydney stockbroker Meares and Philips Ltd. Windfall profits taxes on Bass Strait crude are no longer appropriate in the current economic climate, Story said. The maximum 80 pct levy on old oil -- that discovered before September 1975 -- is now forcing the Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd &lt;BRKN.S>/Exxon Corp &lt;XON> partnership to shut-in production, accelerating the decline in output and reducing government revenue, he said. He said the producer return per barrel at a price of 30 Australian dlrs a barrel would rise to 2.07 dlrs from 0.80 dlrs if the levy was cut to 70 pct. \"The economics at an 80 pct levy are simply not attractive at oil prices below 30 dlrs,\" Story said. Cutting the maximum levy rate to 70 pct would create higher levels of self-sufficiency, increase government revenue, boost exports and provide incentives for exploration and development, he said. The government is currently reviewing the oil tax structure. BP GRANGEMOUTH REFINERY SHUT, HYDROCRACKER DAMAGED The entire British Petroleum Co PLC refinery at Grangemouth in Scotland has been shut down following the explosion and fire that severely damaged the hydrocracker at the site, a refinery spokesman said. He said the rest of the 178,500 bpd refinery, including the 19,000 bpd catalytic cracker, was undamaged. The whole refinery was closed pending enquiries but a decision when to reopen the main units will be taken in the next couple of days, he said. But there was extensive damage to the central part of the 32,000 bpd hydrocracker, which upgrades heavy oil products to gasoline, and it will be out of operation for some months. The spokesman said BP will not suffer supply shortages as a result of the explosion as it will be able to bring in product from other sources. BP has a 437,000 bpd refinery in Rotterdam, a 181,900 bpd unit at Ingolstadt, West Germany, a 181,900 bpd plant at Lavera in France and a smaller Swedish plant. He said the explosion and fire, in which one worker was killed, occurred when the hydrocracker was not in operation. The refinery as a whole had been operating at about half of its capacity since the end of January while an extensive overhaul was carried out on the North Side of the complex where the hydrocracker is sited, he said. This work was scheduled to be completed by mid-April, but this is now being assessed following the hydrocracker accident. Two people were killed in an explosion and fire in a flare line at the Grangemouth refinery on March 13, but the spokesman said this incident was some 100 yards from the latest accident. IRAQ REPORTS RAIDS IRAN\\'S NOWRUZ OIL FIELD Iraq said its warplanes launched two bombing raids on Iran\\'s offshore Nowruz oilfield in the northern Gulf today. A military spokesman, quoted by the official Iraqi news agency, said platforms at the field were reduced \"to rubble.\" He said attacks on the field, 55 miles northwest of Iran\\'s Kharg Island oil terminal, were carried out at 0600 GMT. He said today\\'s raids \"fall within Iraq\\'s policy to deprive Iranian rulers of oil revenue used to serve their aggressive aims.\" Iraqi planes yesterday raided the nearby Ardeshir oil field, resuming attacks on Iranian targets after a month-long lull. IRAN SAYS IT INTENDS NO THREAT TO GULF SHIPPING Iran said reports that it intended to threaten shipping in the Gulf were baseless, and warned the U.S. And other countries not to interfere in the region. Tehran radio, monitored by the BBC, quoted a Foreign Ministry spokesman as saying any attempt at interference would be met by \"a strong response from Iran and other Moslems in the world.\" U.S. Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger, in remarks apparently unrelated to the broadcast, said the U.S. Would do whatever was necessary to keep shipping lanes open in the face of new Iranian anti-ship missiles in the Gulf. The U.S. State Department said two days ago Tehran had been told of U.S. Concern that Iranian anti-ship missiles posed a threat to the free flow of oil from the Gulf. U.S. Officials have said Iran has new Chinese-made anti-ship \"Silkworm\" missiles, which pose a greater threat to merchant ships than missiles used before. The Iranian spokesman said the reports that Iran intended to attack ships were \"misleading propaganda.\" He said Iraq\\'s President Saddam Hussein was the main cause of tension in the Gulf and said Iran would continue to use \"all its legitimate means to stem the cause of tension.\" Weinberger said in a television interview in the U.S. \"We are fully prepared to do what\\'s necessary to keep the shipping going and keep the freedom of navigation available in that very vital waterway.\" \"We aren\\'t going into any disclosures or discussions of what might happen, but we are certainly very sympathetic to and listening carefully to any suggestions for our assistance in keeping navigation free in that area,\" he said. Weinberger said U.S warship movements in the Gulf area were not unusual. A U.S. Navy battle group led by the aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk is currently in the northern Arabian Sea. The Iranian spokesman was quoted by Tehran radio as saying the U.S. Was trying to build up its military presence in the region. STUDY SAYS OIL PRICE FALL SPURS BANKRUPTCIES The sharp drop in world oil prices the past year triggered a 60 pct increase in bankruptcies in the country\\'s oil states, according to a study released by the American Petroleum Institute (API). API said the Dunn and Bradstreet study found that business failures rose nationally by 6.9 pct in 1986 over 1985, but in the \"oil patch\" of the Southwest the increase was 59.9 pct. It said bankruptcies in Texas were up 57.4 pct, Oklahoma, 55.9 pct, Colorado, 55.8 pct and Louisiana, 46.6 pct. In Alaska, failures rose by 66.2 per cent, it said. API also said that three of the states with the highest number of bank failures last year were large oil and gas producers - Texas, Oklahoma and Kansas. WORLD DEPENDENCY ON MIDEAST OIL SAID INEVITABLE The world\\'s dependency on the Mideast as the source for its petroleum is growing and nothing is going to stop it, Donald K. McIvor, an Exxon Corp &lt;XON> Director and senior vice president told Reuters in an interview. \"Non-OPEC production will begin to decline and the gap between demand and supply will widen so that the trend to increasing dependence on OPEC and the Middle East is inevitable,\" McIvor said. Decreased supplies will firm prices for crude oil but are not likely to change a growing dependence, McIvor said. McIvor, Exxon\\'s senior vice president responsible for oil and gas exploration and production said that dependence would result from the Mideast\\'s large spare capacity at a time when the rest of the world consumes more oil than it was finding. \"Since 1970 we\\'ve been consuming oil at rates of 20-25 billion barrels per year while making new discoveries of only about 10-15 bilion barrels per year,\" McIvor said. \"The bulk of the inventory and more than half of the remaining proved reserves lies in the middle east which is producing at much less than current capacity,\" he added. McIvor said that of the some 30,000 oil fields discovered so far only 37 \"one-one thousandth of the total number contained about 35 pct of all the oil ever discovered.\" McIvor said, in response to a question, that he did not believe there were any more \"super giants\", or oil fields with reserves greater than five billion barrels, to be found which would change the conclusion of the world\\'s growing dependency. \"Of those 37 super giants only 11 lie outside the Middle East. Only five of the 37 have been discovered in the past 20 years and only two of these lie outside the middle east (Cantarell in Mexico and Alaska\\'s North Slope).\" McIvor said. McIvor said that many of the large fields outside the U.S. like Alaska\\'s Prudhoe Bay and the North Sea were reaching a peak and would soon begin to decline. But the Exxon executive said that there were still plenty of opportunities to be explored and developed outside of the Middle east, particulartly in Canada, the North Sea, and Australia and Africa. McIvor said that decisions to explore and drill in those areas would be depedent upon both the expectations of a higher price of oil as well as the legal regime affecting the companies. \"The ideal regime is a stable one not one where there is a constant change in policies,\" McIvor said. McIvor said he opposed import subsidies or tariffs used to increase exploration as these only benefit one part of the economy at the expense of other parts of the economy. Asked about the options offered this week by U.S. Energy Secretary Herrington to increase U.S. production McIvor said he could not comment on subjects like the oil depletion allowance now but \"the thrust of his (Herrington) report is valid. It has highlighted the growing dependency on the Middle east and the need to increase U.S. production.\" McIvor also said that he expected natural gas to play a greater role in the future in meeting energy needs. \"Natural gas will have the opportunity to become an increasingly important part of the worlkd\\'s energy supply,\" McIvor said. \"Crude oil will be used more and more as a transportation fuel and natural gas will be used more to generate heat, as an industrial fuel,\" he added. PATRICK PETROLEUM &lt;PPC> TO BUY BAYOU Patrick Petroleum Co said it signed a definitive agreement to buy Bayou Resources Inc. As previously announced, the transaction is valued at about 8.8 mln dlrs, including 2.8 mln dlrs in debt. Under the agreement, Patrick will pay six dlrs per share for each Bayou share, with additional value being given for Bayou\\'s preferred and options. Bayou has 827,000 shares out. Depending upon the results of the re-evaluation of a significant Bayou well as of Jan. 1, 1988, Bayou stockholders may receive up to an additional two mln dlrs in stock and cash, which has not been included in the 8.8 mln dlrs. GREECE SAYS IT HAS RIGHT ON AEGEAN OIL DRILLING Greece, responding to a warning by Turkey against conducting oil activities in the Aegean Sea, said today it had the right to decide where and how to do research or drilling work in the area. A government spokesman said the Greek position was made clear to Turkey\\'s ambassador Nazmi Akiman when he met Greek Foreign Affairs Undersecretary Yannis Kapsis last week. Acting Turkish Prime Minister Kaya Erdem said earlier today Greek activities in the northern Aegean contravened the 1976 Berne Agreement which set the framework for talks on the Aegean continental shelf disputed between Ankara and Athens. The Greek statement today said, \"Greece is not prepared to give up even a trace of its sovereignty rights to the seabed. It has been stressed to...Mr Akiman that the decision where or how to drill belongs exclusively to the Greek government.\" \"The Greek government has repeatedly let the Turkish side know that it considers the 1976 Berne protocol as inactive through the fault of Turkey,\" it said. The Greek statement said Athens was ready to put the continental shelf issue before international courts. IRAQ OIL MINISTER QASSEM AHMED TAQI REPLACED, IRAQI NEWS AGENCY REPORTS IRAQ OIL MINISTER QASSEM AHMED TAQI REPLACED, IRAQI NEWS AGENCY REPORTS IRAQI OIL MINISTER REPLACED - OFFICIAL Iraq\\'s Oil Minister Qassem Ahmed Taqi has been moved to the Heavy Industries ministry, the official Iraqi news agcny INA said tonight. It quoted a Presidential decree appointing Oil Ministry undersecretary Isam Abdul-Rahim Al-Chalaby as the new Oil Minister. The Ministers of Industry and Communication and Transport had both been relieved of their posts, the news agency said. No immediate explanation was given for the changes. Al-Chalaby is the head of the Iraqi National Oil Company. INA said the decree, signed by President Saddam Hussein, relieved the Minister of Heavy Industries, Subhi Yassin Khadeir of his post and appointed him a Presidential adviser. His ministry was formerly known as the Industry and Mineral Resources Ministry. The Minister of Communications and Transport, Abdel-Jabbar Abdel-Rahim al-Asadi was also relieved of his post and replaced by a member of the ruling Baath party regional command, Mohammed Hamza al-Zubeidi. Al-Zubedei is also a Presidential adviser. All three ministers involved in the reshuffle had spent more than four years in their posts. U.S. PREPARED TO ESCORT KUWAITI TANKERS The United States has offered Navy warships to escort Kuwaiti oil tankers into and out of the Gulf where they could be threatened by new Iranian anti-ship missiles, U.S. defense officials said today. \"We believe the Kuwaitis have also approached the Soviet Union about the possibility of using Soviet tankers\" to ship their oil, one of the officials told Reuters. \"But if there is superpower protection, we would rather it come from us,\" the official said. The officials, who asked not to be identified, said Kuwait had asked about possible protection for a dozen vessels, most of them oil tankers, which could be supplied by three U.S. Navy guided missile destroyers and two guided missile frigates now in the southern part of the Gulf. \"We told them we would give them help and we are waiting to hear the Kuwaiti response to our offer,\" one official said. In addition to a half dozen ships in the U.S. Navy\\'s small Mideast Task Force near the Straits of Hormuz, the Pentagon has moved 18 warships -- including the Aircraft Carrier Kitty Hawk -- into the northern Indian Ocean in the past month. White House and defense officials said today that massing of the fleet was routine and had nothing to do with the Iran-Iraq war or Iran\\'s recent stationing of Chinese-made anti-ship missiles near the mouth of the Gulf. The land-based missiles have increased concern in Kuwait and other Middle East countries that their oil shipments might be affected. Several hundred vessels have been confirmed hit in the  Gulf by Iran and Iraq since early 1984. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters today that it was in the U.S. strategic interest to keep the free flow of oil in the gulf and through the Straits of Hormuz. But he said U.S. ships in the region were on routine maneuvers. Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger on Sunday declined to discuss specifics, but said the United States would do whatever was necessary to keep the Gulf shipping open in the face of new Iranian anti-ship missiles in the region. \"We are fully prepared to do what\\'s necessary to keep the shipping going and keep the freedom of navigation available in that very vital waterway of the world,\" he said on NBC television\\'s \"Meet the Press.\" The State Department said Friday Iran has been informed about U.S. concern over the threat to oil shipments in the Gulf. The communciation was sent through Switzerland, which represents American interests in Iran. Iran on Sunday denied as baseless reports that it intended to threaten shipping in the gulf and warned the United States that any interference in the region would meet a strong response from Tehran, Tehran Radio said. An Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman, quoted in a broadcast monitored by the BBC in London, said reports that Iran intends to threaten shipping in the Gulf were baseless. \"In conjunction with this misleading propaganda, America has already paved the ground to achieve its expansionist and hegemonistic intentions, aiming to build up its military presence in the region,\" he was quoted as saying. IRAQ REPORTS ATTACKS ON SUPERTANKER, OIL TARGETS Iraq said today its warplnes had attacked a supertanker and four Iranian oil sites and vowed to keep up such raids until the Gulf war ends. The surprise escalation of attacks on oil installations broke more than a month-long lull in Iraqi air force action. It also followed celebrations yesterday of what Baghdad hailed as Iran\\'s failure to achieve victory during the Iranian year which ended on Saturday. A high command communique said warplanes hit the western jetty at Iran\\'s Kharg island oil terminal in the afternoon and struck a supertanker nearby at the same time. The Kharg terminal, attacked about 135 times since August 1985, was last raided in January. The communique did not identify the supertanker, but said columns of smoke were seen billowing from it. In London, Lloyds insurance said the 162,046-ton Iranian tanker Avaj was hit on Saturday, when Iraq reported an earlier Gulf attack. But there has been no independent confirmation of today\\'s supertanker attack nor of other raids on shipping reported by Baghdad in the past 24 hours. The last confirmed Iraqi attack took place on March eight, when the Iranian tanker Khark-5 was hit south of Kharg. Iraqi warplanes also struck Iran\\'s offshore oilfields at Nowruz, Cyrus and Ardeshir in northern gulf, some 80 km (50 miles) west of Kharg island, today\\'s communique said. The three oilfields have been raided several times in the past three years. Oil sources said they were not crucially important to Iran\\'s oil export trade. A second high command communique today said Iraqi warplanes flew 94 sorties against Iranan targets and positions at the war front. It also reported a clash between Iraqi naval units and several Iranian boats carrying men to attack an Iraqi oil terminal at the northen tip of the Gulf. Two Iranian boats wer destroyed and sunk with their occupants and the others fled, it said. ENERGY ANALYST PROPOSES U.S. OIL TARIFF Energy analyst Edward Krapels said the United States should consider an oil tariff to keep U.S. dependence on imports below 50 pct. \"On the supply side, the argument in favor of a contingent, variable import tariff is most persuasive,\" Krapels, president of Energy Security Analysis, Inc said in a statement at a House Energy and Power subcommittee hearing. \"An optimal tariff would be one implemented only if the international price of crude oil falls below, say, 15 dlrs a barrel. On the demand side, the obvious policy is an excise tax on transportation fuels,\" Krapels said. But William Johnson of the Jofree Corp disagreed with the oil tariff proposal, saying Congress should remove price controls on natural gas, repeal the windfall profits tax on oil companies, allow exports of Alaskan oil and provide tax incentives for U.S. oil production, or, at the least, preserve exisiting tax incentives for drilling. He also urging filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve at a faster rate. Richard Adkerson of Arthur Andersen and Co told the subcommittee oil imports were expected to increase because funds for exploration and development of domestic oil sources cannot now be economically justified due to low oil prices. IRAQ REPLACES OIL MINISTER IN BIG GOVT SHUFFLE Iraqi President Saddam Hussein carried out his first major government shakeup in five years tonight, naming a new oil minister in shuffling three posts. One minister was dropped in the shuffle, announced in a presidential decree. It gave no reason for the changes in the government of the Arab Baath Socialist Party which has ruled Iraq since a revolution in 1968. The decree named the head of the Iraqi National Oil Company (INOC), Isam Abdul-Rahim al-Chalaby, to take over as oil minister replacing Qassem Ahmed Taqi. Taqi, appointed oil minister in the last significant government reorganization in 1982, was moved to be minister of heavy industries. IRAQ REPORTS ATTACKS ON SUPERTANKER, OIL TARGETS Iraq said its warplanes had attacked a supertanker and four Iranian oil sites and vowed to keep up such raids until the Gulf war ends. The surprise escalation of attacks on oil installations broke more than a month-long lull in Iraqi air force action. It also followed celebrations yesterday of what Baghdad hailed as Iran\\'s failure to achieve victory during the Iranian year which ended on Saturday. A high command communique said warplanes hit the western jetty at Iran\\'s Kharg island oil terminal in the afternoon and struck a supertanker nearby at the same time. The Kharg terminal, attacked about 135 times since August 1985, was last raided in January. The communique did not identify the supertanker, but said columns of smoke were seen billowing from it. In London, Lloyds insurance said the 162,046-ton Iranian tanker Avaj was hit on Saturday, when Iraq reported an earlier Gulf attack. But there has been no independent confirmation of today\\'s supertanker attack nor of other raids on shipping reported by Baghdad in the past 24 hours. The last confirmed Iraqi attack took place on March 8, when the Iranian tanker Khark-5 was hit south of Kharg. Iraqi warplanes also struck Iran\\'s offshore oilfields at Nowruz, Cyrus and Ardeshir in northern gulf, some 80 km (50 miles) west of Kharg island, today\\'s communique said. HUGHES\\' U.S. RIG COUNT RISES TO 784 U.S. drilling activity rose last week with the number of working rotary rigs up by 23 to 784, against 1,063 working rigs one year ago, Hughes Tool Co. said. The improvement was the first increase this year in the weekly rig count, which had dropped steadily since early January when a total of 962 rotary rigs were working. Among individual states, Texas and Oklahoma reported the biggest gains in drilling last week with increases of 21 and 11, respectively. California and Louisiana were each up by three and Wyoming gained two additional working rigs. Hughes Tool said it counted a total of 692 rigs drilling on land, 74 rigs active offshore and 18 drilling in inland waters. In Canada, the rig count was up by two to 183, against 324 one year ago. AUSTRALIAN MINISTER SEES TARGETED OIL TAX STRATEGY Australia\\'s crude oil tax strategy is probably best tackled in terms of a targeted rather than broadly-based approach, Federal Resources and Energy Minister Gareth Evans told a meeting here. He told the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association (APEA) annual conference there was a prospect of developing a package that would recognise the government\\'s economic priorities while also meeting some of the industry\\'s concerns. Evans was referring to a nearly completed government review of oil taxation. Evans said there were plenty of examples where targeted approaches to oil industry taxation had produced good results in recent years. These include the reduction in the top marginal crude excise rate on \\'old\\' Bass Strait oil found before September 1975 to 80 pct from 87 pct, and the waiver of excise on onshore oil announced last September, he said. The industry, through the APEA, has been calling for the elimination of secondary taxation on oil in order to boost incentives for prospecting against a background of weak prices and Australia\\'s relatively low exploration levels. \"While nobody wants to add further unnecessary complexity to an already complex taxation regime, I am inclined to favour these kinds of tailored approaches ahead of sweeping changes, which leave (government) revenue much reduced and may still leave a lot of uncertainty as to what individual companies are going to do in major areas,\" Evans said. He said the government did not intend to change its resource rent taxation (RRT) legislation, now before parliament, in response to industry calls to allow all exploration expenditure in a given area to be deductible. As previously reported, RRT is a tax of 40 pct limited to highly prospective offshore areas, based on profits after a certain rate of return has been achieved for individual projects. APEA has said it is not a true profit-based tax because exploration deductibility is limited to successful projects. Evans said the decision not to change RRT was based more than anything on the government\\'s desire to ensure the certainty and stability of the new regime, adding that major investments have already been planned on the existing ground rules. SHELL AUSTRALIA REPORTS 45.79 MLN DLR 1986 PROFIT Royal Dutch/Shell Group &lt;RD.AMS> unit &lt;Shell Australia Ltd>, said its net profit fell to 45.79 mln dlrs in 1986 from 66.76 mln in 1985. Revenue fell to 4.55 billion dlrs from 4.91 billion, in an extremely competitive and over-regulated environment, chairman and chief executive Kevan Gosper said in a statement. A 26.25 mln dlr annual dividend would be paid to the parent after a very disappointing year. \"A return of 2.2 pct on funds employed represents a very meagre return ... In an economy suffering from inflation of around 10 pct,\" he said. Gosper said the results reflected heavy reliance on downstream oil and chemicals, poor coal and metal returns and the financial burden of the North-West Shelf gas project. Duties, royalties and taxes rose to 1.37 billion dlrs against 852.72 mln in 1985 and Gosper urged the government to move quickly to lift costly and unnecessary regulation. \"It is just as important for Australia to maintain a financially healthy, technically advanced refining and marketing industry as it is to sustain oil exploration and production,\" he said. \"The Australian oil industry has the experience and the capacity to serve the nation and its shareholders well if the government would stop putting roadblocks in our way,\" he said. Shell invested 500 mln dlrs over the past five years to upgrade its oil refining and marketing business, but further investment required an appropriate rate of return, he said. Exploration and evaluation spending in 1986 fell to 18.77 mln dlrs from 26.35 mln, while investment in property and plant rose to 374.25 mln from 353.94 mln a year earlier. Gosper said oil companies would be under intense pressure in 1987 because of forecast slow economic growth. WORLD BANK CHIEF PLEDGES SUPPORT TO INDONESIA World Bank president Barber Conable pledged the Bank\\'s support to help Indonesia adjust to lower world oil prices, but said further deregulation of its protected economy was needed. Speaking to reporters after talks with President Suharto, he said he expected Jakarta to do more to liberalise the economy and deregulate trade policy. Indonesia, hurt by the fall in oil prices last year which cut the value of its crude exports in half, is the Third World\\'s sixth largest debtor. It has received 10.7 billion dlrs from the World Bank in the past 20 years. Conable said the World Bank, which granted Indonesia a 300 mln dlr loan last month to help its balance of payments, was prepared to back Jakarta in taking the right steps to adjust to lower oil and primary commodity prices. \"We are prepared to support those steps which we believe are consistent with the development of the Indonesian economy,\" he said. He said Jakarta\\'s willingness to move quickly after last year\\'s collapse in oil price saved Indonesia from some of the difficulties now faced by other countries. Indonesia devalued its currency by 31 pct against the dollar in September to avoid a balance of payments crisis, and has announced a series of measures since May intended to stimulate exports, encourage foreign investment and revitalise the economy. However, key monopolies in areas like steel and plastics and high tariff barriers remain in place. Conable arrived in Indonesia on Saturday and has since met 14 Indonesian cabinet ministers to review the country\\'s borrowing needs and the impact of falling oil prices on the country. KUWAIT SAYS OPEC 2.4 MLN BPD BELOW CEILING Kuwaiti oil minister Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah said OPEC was producing well below its oil output ceiling and this would help prices move higher, according to a Kuwaiti newspaper interview. The al-Rai al-Aam newspaper quoted him as saying OPEC was pumping 2.4 mln barrels per day (bpd) less than its 15.8 mln bpd ceiling, while consumers were drawing down their petroleum stocks at a rate of 4.5 mln bpd. As long as OPEC maintains its output curbs, demand for its oil will rise in April and May, Sheikh Ali said, adding that Kuwait was strongly committed to its OPEC quota. AUSTRALIAN OIL INDUSTRY TO CONTINUE TAX CAMPAIGN The council of the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association (APEA) said it will press on with its campaign for major improvements to Australia\\'s petroleum taxation structure. The council said in a statement the industry was bitterly disappointed by the Australian government\\'s position on taxation, as presented in a speech by Resources and Energy Minister Gareth Evans to the APEA conference. As earlier reported, Evans said he was inclined to target any tax changes rather than take a broad-based approach to secondary taxation of petroleum. APEA had expected the government to make positive responses to detailed industry submissions seeking the removal of existing secondary tax disincentives to exploration and development, the council said. It said it plans to reply in detail to issues raised by Evans, but its immediate concern was the decision to proceed with the current resource rental tax (RRT) legislation. Evans told the conference the government did not plan to accept industry pleas for changes in the legislation to allow deductibility of unsuccessful exploration expenditure. \"The government\\'s unwillingness to allow the deduction of unsuccessful exploration expenditure within the whole offshore area in which RRT applies negates any claim that the tax is profit based,\" the APEA council said. The government missed a major opportunity to persuade oil exploration companies that it had realistic answers to the industry\\'s concerns, despite its recognition of the industry\\'s problems, the council said. The industry has called for the end of all discriminatory secondary taxation of petroleum, citing them as major disincentives at a time of low oil prices. SANTOS SAYS PROFITS HIT BY OIL PRICE FALL Leading Australian onshore oil and gas producer, Santos Ltd &lt;STOS.S>, said its 1986 results were hit by sharp reductions in prices for crude oil, condensate and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). The Cooper Basin producer earlier reported a fall in net profit to 88.67 mln dlrs from 144.04 mln in 1985. Santos chairman Sir Brian Massy-Greene said in a statement that increased production, particularly of oil and LPG, along with reduced operating costs and reduced or deferred oil exploration and development outlays, were helping Santos deal with an adverse business climate. Santos said it remained financially strong with an injection of 84 mln dlrs from the second instalment of a 1985 rights issue, and had cash reserves of 381.3 mln dlrs at the end of 1986 against 401.9 mln a year earlier. It said it had also made significant progress in repaying debts and at year end the ratio of debt to shareholders\\' funds had fallen to 1.01 from 1.54. Santos yesterday announced a 4.00 dlr a share takeover bid for the 96.93 pct it did not already hold in oil and gas company &lt;TMOC Resources Ltd> -- valuing the target at 248.5 mln dlrs. Santos said 75 pct of its loans were U.S. Dollar denominated and significant currency purchases were made during the year to maintain that natural hedge. At year end it held 145 mln U.S. Dlrs, enough to meet all 1987 repayments. Santos said it had a successful gas exploration program, finding 172 billion cubic feet in South Australia, but oil exploration was less successful with 1.62 mln barrels added to reserves -- less than depletion during the year. Cooper Basin producers are committed to a two-year scheme to double gas exploration while Santos said its 1987 budget for oil exploration had been boosted 20 pct. Santos said the outlook for 1987 depended on prices and production volumes but with extra oil exploration and encouraging gas finds there were grounds for optimism. But it called on the goverment to continue fostering domestic producers through the Import Parity Price scheme. \"It makes no sense to abandon this policy now when exploration is at its lowest level for many years and when Australia\\'s oil self-sufficency is expected to decline rapidly,\" Massy-Green said. KUWAIT SAYS OPEC 2.4 MLN BPD BELOW CEILING Kuwaiti oil minister Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah said OPEC was producing well below its oil output ceiling and this would help prices move higher, according to a Kuwaiti newspaper interview. The al-Rai al-Aam newspaper quoted him as saying OPEC was pumping 2.4 mln barrels per day (bpd) less than its 15.8 mln bpd ceiling, while consumers were drawing down their petroleum stocks at a rate of 4.5 mln bpd. As long as OPEC maintains its output curbs, demand for its oil will rise in April and May, Sheikh Ali said, adding that Kuwait was strongly committed to its OPEC quota. U.S. OFFERS TO ESCORT KUWAITI TANKERS IN GULF The U.S. Has offered warships to escort Kuwaiti tankers in the Gulf past Iranian anti-ship missile batteries, Defence Department officials said. The officials told Reuters yesterday the offer was made last week by Navy Admiral William Crowe, chairman of the Pentagon Joint Chiefs of Staff, during a Middle East visit. Reagan administration officials said later that Washington did not seek military confrontation with Tehran, but would not let Iran use Chinese-made \"Silkworm\" anti-ship missiles, capable of covering the narrow entrance to the Gulf, to choke oil shipments to the West. Defence officials said Kuwait had asked if protection for up to a dozen vessels, most of them tankers, could be provided by three U.S. Navy destroyers and two frigates now in the southern Gulf and the Gulf of Oman. In addition to a half dozen ships in the U.S. Navy\\'s small Mideast Task Force near the Straits of Hormuz, the Pentagon has moved 18 warships, including the aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk, into the northern Arabian Sea in the past month. White House and defence officials said that massing the fleet was routine and had nothing to do with the Iran-Iraq war or Iran\\'s stationing of missiles near the mouth of the Gulf. The State Department said on Friday that Iran has been told about U.S. Concern over the threat to oil shipments in the Gulf. The communication was sent through Switzerland, which represents U.S. Interests in Iran. Iran denied as baseless reports that it intended to threaten shipping in the Gulf and said any U.S. Interference in the region would meet a strong response, Tehran Radio said on Sunday. Several hundred vessels have been confirmed hit in the Gulf by Iran and Iraq since early 1984 in the so-called tanker war, an offshoot of their 6-1/2-year-old ground conflict. OPEC WITHIN OUTPUT CEILING, SUBROTO SAYS Opec remains within its agreed output ceiling of 15.8 mln barrels a day, and had expected current fluctuations in the spot market of one or two dlrs, Indonesian Energy Minister Subroto said. He told reporters after meeting with President Suharto that present weakness in the spot oil market was the result of warmer weather in the U.S. And Europe which reduced demand for oil. Prices had also been forced down because refineries were using up old stock, he said. He denied that Opec was exceeding its agreed production ceiling. Asked what Opec\\'s output level was now, he replied: \"Below 15.8 (mln barrels per day).\" He did not elaborate. He said there appeared to have been some attempts to manipulate the market, but if all Opec members stick by the cartel\\'s December pricing agreement it would get through present price difficulties. He predicted that prices would recover again in the third and fourth quarters of 1987. He also reiterated that there was no need for an emergency Opec meeting. He said Opec had expected to see some fluctuations in the spot price. \"We hope the weak price will be overcome, and predict the price will be better in the third and fourth quarters.\" Refiners, he said, appeared to have used up old stock deliberately to cause slack demand in the market and the price to fall. But Opec would get through this period if members stuck together. IRAN WARNS U.S. NOT TO INTERVENE IN THE GULF The speaker of the Iranian Parliament, Hojatoleslam Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, warned the U.S. Not to intervene in the Gulf, a day after Washington said its warships were available to escort Kuwaiti tankers through the waterway. \"If U.S. Intervention occurs, the entire world will become insecure for the Americans and the events of Lebanon could be repeated for the Americans everywhere,\" he said. U.S. Defence officials disclosed in Washington yesterday that the U.S. Navy, which has about 24 warships in or near the Gulf, was prepared to escort Kuwaiti tankers, regular targets for Iranian attacks in an offshoot of its war with Iraq. Rafsanjani, in an interview reported by the Iranian news agency IRNA, also commented on earlier U.S. Disclosures that Iran had erected sites for new Chinese-made Silkworm anti-shipping missiles at the Strait of Hormuz. The agency, received in London, quoted him as saying that Iran did not need missiles to close the strait, 24 miles wide at its narrowest, because \"we can close it with artillery only.\" He added \"We have the longest coasts and the highest interest here and the small southern (Gulf) states have a lesser interest compared with us and therefore it is natural for us to protect the security of the Strait of Hormuz more than others.\" SHELL TO DECLARE NORWAY\\'S DRAUGEN FIELD COMMERCIAL &lt;A/S Norske Shell>, Royal Dutch/Shell Group\\'s &lt;RD.AS> Norwegian subsidiary, said it has nearly concluded a 10 billion crown development scheme for Norway\\'s Draugen oil field and will declare the field commercial in the near future. Pending government approval of the scheme, the field could come on stream in 1992, making it Norway\\'s northermost field development and the first such project on the Haltenbanken tract off central Norway. Work on the project could begin as early as January 1988, a Shell spokesman said. Shell has not released projected output levels for the field, where water depth is 240-270 meters. The spokesman said the field\\'s partners have agreed to develop Draugen with a 300-meter, single-leg concrete gravity-base platform. The scheme also proposes using remote subsea production wells to tap the field\\'s reservoir, estimated to contain 375 mln barrels of oil, and an offshore buoy-loading system to transport oil from the field by ship. Partners on Draugen are Shell, the operator, with a 30 pct stake, British Petroleum Co Plc &lt;BP.L> unit &lt;BP Petroleum Development (Norway) Ltd> (20 pct) and state-owned Den Norske Stats Oljeselskap A/S &lt;STAT.OL> (Statoil) (50 pct). U.S. ENERGY SECRETARY OPTIMISTIC ON INCENTIVES U.S. Department of Energy Secretary John Herrington said he was \"optimistic\" about the chances of providing a more generous depletion allowance for oil and gas producers, but added that the plan faces strong opposition from some members of the Reagan administration. Herrington, speaking to Houston oil executives at a breakfast meeting, said administration debate over his plan for a 27.5 pct annual depletion allowance was \"heavy and strong\" largely because of some fears that the U.S. oil industry could eventually become as dependent on federal subsidies as the agriculture industry. Herrington\\'s proposed tax incentives for the oil industry were issued last week after the Department of Energy released a comprehensive report finding U.S. national security could be jeopardized by rising oil imports. In response to a question from Mitchell Energy and Development Corp &lt;MND> chairman, George Mitchell, Herrington said the report did not definitively rule out an oil import tarrif. \"We intend to keep that debate open,\" Herrington said. However, following his speech, Herrington told Reuters that the new report shows an oil import fee \"is not economical.\" Herrington said, for example, a 10 dlr per barrel tariff on oil imports would cause the nation\\'s gross national product to drop by as much as 32 billion dlrs. Herrington also said he believed President Reagan, who requested the comprehensive national security study, was committed to some action to help the ailing U.S. oil industry. \"I\\'m quite confident he understands the problems and is prepared to do something about it,\" Herrington said. U.S. SUPREME COURT ALLOWS OFFSHORE ALASKAN OIL AND GAS EXPLORATION U.S. SUPREME COURT ALLOWS OFFSHORE ALASKAN OIL AND GAS EXPLORATION U.S. COURT ALLOWS OFFSHORE ALASKAN EXPLORATION A unanimous Supreme Court ruled that oil and gas exploration can proceed on two tracts off the Alaska coast which were leased by the federal government to eight major oil companies. The ruling was an important victory for the oil companies and the Reagan administration\\'s controversial off-shore leasing program and a setback for two small Alaskan villages that challenged the leases by claiming damage to the environment. The administration said that the court-ordered halt in drilling had created uncertainty over the 4.2 billion dlrs paid for 621 leases off the shores of Alaska since December 1980. A federal appeals court ordered the oil companies to halt all exploration and remove all drilling rigs from two tracts in the Bering Sea off Alaska because of possible harm to the subsistence needs and culture of native Eskimos. But the Supreme Court said the appeals court was wrong in issuing an injunction halting exploration. \"Here, injury to subsistence resources from exploration was not at all probable,\" Justice Byron White wrote for the court. \"And on the other side of the balance of harms was the fact that the oil companies had committed approximately 70 mln dlrs to exploration to be conducted during the summer of 1985 which they would have lost without chance of recovery had exploration been enjoined,\" he said. The oil companies, Amoco Corp &lt;AN>, ARCO, Exxon Corp &lt;XON>, Mobil Corp &lt;MOB>, Sohio, Shell, Texaco Inc &lt;TX> and Union Oil, had said that voiding previously granted leases would result in staggering financial losses. The first lease sale in 1983 involved 2.4 mln acres and generated 318 mln dlrs while the second lease sale in 1984 covered 37 mln acres and produced 516 mln dlrs. Administration officials, saying the lease sales were preceded by an intense environmental impact study, denied that the oil and gas exploration would hurt subsistence resources. The Alaskan villages of Gambell and Stebbins, along with an organization of Eskimo natives on the Yukon Delta, argued that the drilling would hurt native hunting and fishing. LOWER TAX OFFSETS LOWER SHELL U.K. UPSTREAM PROFIT &lt;Shell U.K. Ltd\\'s> pre-tax profit on exploration and production operations fell to 869 mln stg in 1986 from 2.12 billion in 1985 due to the fall in oil prices last year, Shell U.K. Finance director Nigel Haslam said. But he told a press conference that due to the high marginal tax rate on North Sea operations, the main impact of the drop in profit was absorbed by a fall in taxation to 330 mln stg from 1.45 billion in 1985. The bulk of tax last year was Corporation Tax, with Petroleum Revenue Tax (PRT) representing only 16 mln stg, he said. As a result, post-tax profit from the exploration and production sector fell by only 126 mln stg to 539 mln. Earlier, Shell U.K., a subsidiary of Royal Dutch/Shell Group &lt;RD.AS>, reported an overall net profit of 757 mln stg, up from 667 mln in 1985, on sales of 6.57 billion stg against 8.81 mln. Shell U.K. Chairman Bob Reid said the company\\'s crude oil output from the North Sea was at a record 373,000 bpd in 1986, which would almost certainly prove to be a peak for the company. Shell expects a fall in output of around 10 pct in the current year to around 340,000 bpd, due mainly to the decline in output from the major Brent field, he said. Gas output of 5.9 billion cubic metres and natural gas liquids output of around one mln tonnes in 1986 are expected to be maintained in 1987, he said. A final decision on development of the Kittiwake and Osprey North Sea oil fields will be made in the next 12 to 18 months, Reid said. The Kittiwake field, originally part of the 2.5 billion stg Gannet project abandoned last year when the oil price fell, is now estimated to cost around 350 mln stg. Economies on development costs for the Tern and Eider North Sea fields, which were approved last year, have brought the cost down to 30 to 35 pct below the original budget. Day to day operating costs of the exploration and production sector had been cut 10 pct last year, and the target is to keep costs per barrel constant. The company drilled 17 wells offshore, with 10 leading to the discovery of hydrocarbons, although it is too early to gauge the commercial viability of these discoveries, Reid said. Restructuring of the downstream oil sector contributed to a profit rise to 187 mln stg in 1986 from 91 mln stg in 1985. Jaap Klootwijk, managing director of downstream unit &lt;Shell U.K. Oil>, said refining margins in the first quarter of 1987 were a \"bit better than the very bad fourth quarter 1986.\" In November and December in particular, refining operations had shown negative margins following the fall in crude and oil product prices, he said. He expected margins to continue generally positive over the summer, although they could dip to become negative from time to time, depending on price movements. A new catalytic cracker at Shell\\'s Stanlow refinery will now come on stream by the end of first quarter 1988, about five months behind schedule, following a crane accident which severely damaged the plant last year, he said. Profits from the chemicals sector rose to 33 mln stg from 11 mln after the rationalisation of the Carrington chemical site. Haslam said the Budget announcement on PRT relief, by which companies will be allowed to offset up to 10 pct of qualifying development expenditure on certain future oil fields against PRT, was \"helpful,\" but rather less than had been hoped for. Reid said his estimate of crude oil prices this year was in the range of 15 to 18 dlrs. If prices went much above that, he would expect some over-production above OPEC\"s official 15.8 mln bpd output ceiling which would tend to bring prices back down. He said it looked as if the December OPEC pact to restrain output was holding, bringing supply and demand into balance, but the test will come in summer when demand for OPEC oil will fall. OIL TAX BREAK RIDICULED BY U.S. HOUSE TAXWRITER A House taxwriter said Energy Secretary James Herrington\\'s \"outrageous\" plan to restore an old tax break for oil companies was both bad tax and energy policy. Rep. Pete Stark, a California Democrat and senior House Ways and Means Committee member, said Herrington\\'s plan for a 27.5 pct depletion allowance--which in effect is a special 27.5 pct tax deduction --would cost seven billion dlrs a year. \"He must have missed the last two years of federal tax reform by sleeping as soundly as Rip Van Winkle,\" Stark said. He said in a statement the oil industry already pays an effective lower rate of U.S. tax on investment, 15 pct versus aggregate corporate tax on all investment of 34 pct, according to a recent Congressional Research Service study. MOSCOW SUPPORTS FREE GULF NAVIGATION, ENVOY SAYS The Soviet Union supports the freedom of navigation in the Gulf and does not support any act which would cause the deterioration of the situation in the region, its ambassador to Kuwait, Ernest Zverev, told the Kuwaiti news agency KUNA. \"We support the freedom of navigation in the Arabian Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz,\" the agency quoted Zverev as saying. KUNA also said the envoy had discussed the deployment of Iranian missiles near the Strait of Hormuz with Kuwaiti Foreign Undersecretary Suliman Majed al-Shaheen. A British naval source in the Gulf said today Iran had test-fired its new Silkworm missiles and set up launching sites in the area. The tests had been successful and the missiles could be used against shipping in the strait, the source added. But Iranian Parliamentary Speaker Hojatoleslam Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani said Iran did not need missiles to close the strait because \"we can close it with artillery only.\" The U.S. Has said it will not allow Iran to use missiles to choke off oil shipments and offered its warships to escort Kuwaiti tankers past the missile batteries in the strait. DRAWDOWN SEEN IN U.S. DISTILLATE STOCKS Tonight\\'s American Petroleum Institute oil inventory report is expected to show another drawdown in distillate stocks of between two and 7.5 mln barrels for the week ending March 20, oil analysts and traders said. They said they expect gasoline inventories to be depleted by about one to four mln barrels. Analysts were divided on the crude stocks. Some saw stocks unchanged to as much as three mln barrels higher. Others said stocks could be down one to five mln barrels. Crude throughput volumes are expected to be unchanged to slightly higher or lower than the week ended March 13, traders said. The API recorded a 7.4 mln barrel stockdraw for U.S. distillates in the week ended March 13. Analysts see another draw reflecting historic seasonal trends. For the week ended March 13, API reported gasoline stocks down 2.9 mln barrels. Those expecting a draw of as much as four mln barrels said they are looking for fairly high consumption rates as the spring and summer driving season gets underway this year, because retail prices are still low compared to recent years. U.S. crude oil stocks were reported down by 4.4 mln barrels for the week ended March 13. Analysts are divided over the outcome for last week because there is uncertainty about whether throughput levels increased or decreased last week. Some see crude stock levels unchanged to three mln barrels higher, while others think inventories could be as much as five mln barrels below the previous week. The lower estimates are supported by the belief that crude runs increased and imports fell. The API reported crude runs 154,000 b/d higher for the week ended March 13. Analysts are calling it unchanged to slightly up or down for the week ended March 20. Expectations for product stockdraws are already being reflected in firmer prices, traders said. But if draws are at the higher end of the estimated range, they added, the effect will be bullish. Any stockbuild would be a negative factor, they said. Crude runs normally increase in March, and any decrease in runs would be friendly to the market, said Peter Beutel of Elders Energy Futures Inc. GOODYEAR &lt;GT> UNIT TO START UP PIPELINE Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co said the All American Pipeline of its Celeron Corp subsidiary will start line fill activities on March 30 as it begins operating. The company said about five mln barrels of oil will be required to pack the completed segment of the line, which runs 1,225 miles from near Santa Barbara, Calif., to existing pipeline connections in West Texas.  Construction has also staqrted this week on a 43-mile, 16-inch diameter gathering line to deliver 75,000 to 100,000 barrels a day of oil from the San Joaquin Valley in California.  The 30-inch main underground line can transport over 300,000 barrels daily. CALUMET INDUSTRIES &lt;CALI> SEES 2ND QTR LOSS Calumet Industries Inc said it expects to report a loss from operations for its second quarter ending March 31, despite a strong unit sales increase. In the same year-ago period the company reported net income of 366,953 dlrs, or 18 cts a share. Chairman S. Mark Salvino said the expected loss is primarily due to depressed product prices not recovering the increasing cost of crude oil. Salvino also said steadier crude prices and the reduced rate of refinery production should increase product prices and lead to a return to more normal profit margins. He reported that the 23 mln dlr HydroCal II system under construction at the company\\'s refinery in Princeton, La., is on schedule and production will begin early in fiscal 1988. PDVSA INCOME ON OIL SALES FELL 45 PCT IN 1986 The state oil company Petroeleos de Venezuela ended 1986 with a decrease of 45 pct in income from oil sales even though it surpassed its own export goal by almost 100,000 barrels a day, Minister of Energy and Mines Arturo Hernandez Grisanti said. Speaking to a news conference following the PDVSA annual assembly, Hernandez said PDVSA\\'s income from oil sales had dropped to 7.2 billion dlrs in 1986, down 45 pct from last year\\'s 13.3 billion. Fiscal revenue from oil sales, which was estimated at 66 billion bolivares for 1986, totalled 43.5 billion, a drop of 34 pct which Hernandez said \"had a very serious impact on Venezuela.\" PDVSA\\'s export volume averaged 1.508 mln barrels a day, of which 658,000 bpd were crude oil and 850,000 bpd refined products. The figure surpassed PDVSA\\'s stated goal of 1.410 mln bpd and the 1985 export volume of 1.371 mln bpd. But it was not enough to cover the losses from a drop in the average price from 25.88 dlrs per barrel in 1985 to 13.90 dlrs last year. The 13.90 per barrel price for 1986 was 1.01 dlrs higher than the figure originally announced by the Central Bank. Hernandez said the increase had come from a new accounting system which included the results of PDVSA\\'s overseas refining and marketing operations. Consumption in Venezuela\\'s internal market increased from 323,000 bpd in 1985 to 342,000 bpd last year. However, Hernandez stressed that the government had managed to keep gasoline sales almost constant at 164,000 bpd. Exploration by PDVSA led to an increase of 675 mln barrels in reserves of light and medium crudes, shifting the balance of Venezuela\\'s reserves away from heavy crude oil. The country\\'s production capacity at year-end 1986 was 2.562 mln bpd, of which 1.420 mln are light and medium crudes, Hernandez said. Venezuela\\'s total proven reserves as of December 31, 1986 were 55.521 billion barrels, the fourth largest amount in the world, Hernandez said. IMPERIAL OIL &lt;IMO.A> TO FOCUS ON HIGHER PROFIT Imperial Oil Ltd, 70 pct owned by Exxon Corp &lt;XON>, will focus on maintaining its financial strength and improving near-term earnings performance through operating expense reductions and selective capital spending, the company said in the annual report. Imperial Oil said it expects to spend about 750 mln dlrs on capital and exploration expenditures in 1987, compared to 648 mln dlrs in 1986 and 1.16 billion dlrs in 1985. Imperial previously reported 1986 operating net profit fell to 440 mln dlrs or 2.69 dlrs share from 694 mln dlrs or 4.27 dlrs share in the prior year. Imperial Oil said the attention to earnings results from the desire to pursue longer term growth opportunities should the investment climate improve and the belief that low or volatile crude oil prices could continue during the next several years. The company also said actions initiated during 1986 to restructure and improve efficiency should continue to show benefits in 1987. During 1986, the company cut operating, administrative and marketing expenses by 91 mln dlrs and reduced the number of workers by 16 pct to 12,500. Imperial chairman Arden Haynes said in the annual report that it is too early to determine whether the recent upward movement in international oil prices will be sustained. \"It is still a time for prudence and caution, and the company\\'s actions will continue to be based on the fundamentals of market supply and demand,\" he said. Haynes said prospects for the company\\'s petroleum products division are more promising than before, but are still uncertain. Imperial\\'s 1986 petroleum earnings rose to 174 mln dlrs from 102 mln dlrs in 1985. Haynes said more satisfactory product margins on its petroleum products could result if demand recovers as it has in the United States. The company\\'s chemicals business outlook is mixed, Haynes said. Prospects for growth in petrochemical sales is good as long as economic growth continues, but future large grain surpluses could dampen fertilizer demand and maintain pressure on prices. Imperial\\'s chemical business earned 17 mln dlrs in 1986, compared to three mln dlrs in 1985. CALTEX TO RAISE BAHRAIN OIL PRODUCT PRICES Caltex Petroleum Corp said it will raise posted prices for naphtha and several grades of residual fuel in Bahrain, effective March 25. Caltex, a joint venture of Chevron Corp &lt;CHV> and Texaco INC &lt;TX>, said its naphtha posting is up four cts a gallon to 43 cts. It said it is raising its marine diesel oil posting by 30 cts a barrel to 20.24 dlrs a barrel. Light, medium, and heavy fuel oil postings are up 1.50 dlrs a barrel, the company said. This will bring the light fuel oil price to 16.90 dlrs, medium to 15.50 dlrs, and heavy to 14.60 dlrs, the company said. API SAYS DISTILLATE STOCKS OFF 4.07 MLN BBLS, GASOLINE OFF 2.69 MLN, CRUDE UP 8.53 MLN API SAYS DISTILLATE STOCKS OFF 4.07 MLN BBLS, GASOLINE OFF 2.69 MLN, CRUDE UP 8.53 MLN VENEZUELA TO ANNOUCE PARTNER FOR COAL VENTURE Petroleos de Venezuela S.A will announce within two weeks the name of a foreign consortium it has chosen to help exploit the coal deposits at Guasare in western Zulia state, PDVSA president Juan Chacin Guzman said. Chacin told reporters the foreign partner will provide capital as well as technical and marketing expertise to the Carbozulia project, which the state oil company will manage. PDVSA officials said that among those who bid for the partnership is a consortium between Agip Carbone, a subsidiary of Italy\\'s Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi (ENI), and Atlantic Richfield &lt;ARC> of the United States. Minister of Energy and Mines Arturo Hernandez Grisanti said discussions are currently taking place to finalize the terms of the contract with the foreign partner. PDVSA vice-president Pablo Reimpell said last week the first shipment of coal from the Carbozulia project should be made during the final quarter of 1987, and would measure between 100-150,000 metric tons. Plans call for production to eventually reach 500,000 mt annually. Reimpell said the original investment in the project will be approximately 8 billion bolivars. MADAGASCAR EXTENDS AMOCO OIL EXPLORATION AGREEMENT Madagascar extended its oil exploration agreement with the U.S. Firm Amoco Corp &lt;AN> for 17 months to allow for further studies of the Morondava basin on the southwest coast, a government statement said. It said the existing five-year agreement, due to expire this July 24, was extended until the end of 1988 to allow for additional geological and geophysical studies. Amoco has so far laid 7,100 km of seismic lines and sunk five exploration wells in the Morondava basin. It may drill a further three wells before the end of the extended exploration period, the statement said. Madagascar has signed oil exploration agreements with four foreign oil companies since 1981. But despite promising indications of large reserves, no commercial production plans have yet been announced. The foreign firms - Amoco, Occidental Petroleum Corp &lt;OXY>, Mobil Corp &lt;MOB> and a unit of &lt;Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi> - are working in partnership with the National Military Office for Strategic Industries (OMNIS). Roland Ratsimandresy, the director general of OMNIS, said at a ceremenony to sign the extension of the Amoco agreement that his department would intensify oil exploration with its existing partners and would soon offer a new round of exploration licences. PEMEX SIGNS 500 MLN DLR JAPAN LOAN FOR PIPELINE Mexican state oil firm Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex) signed for a 500 mln dlruntied loan from the Export-Import Bank of Japan to finance its Pacific Petroleum Project, Pemex Japan representative Tito Ayal said. No further details on the loan were immediately available. Ayala told an oil seminar the project, due for completion in 1988, is aimed at improving distribution of oil products in the domestic market, mainly along the Pacific coast. The project consists of a pipeline linking Nueva Teapa on the Gulf of Mexico with Salina Cruz on the Pacific Coast, and construction of the second phase of the Salina Cruz refinery. The project also includes construction of liquified petroleum gas (LPG) storage tanks at Santa Cruz, additional crude oil storage at both ends of the pipeline, an ammonia complex at Lazaro Cardenas on the Pacific Coast and expansion of the infrastructure of the port of Salina Cruz, Ayala said. Pemex will buy 80 mln dlrs worth of foreign equipment and materials for the project, he said. The new pipeline will enable Japan to load Mexico\\'s Maya crude oil at Salina Cruz rather than in the Gulf of Mexico. Pemex will also have some LPG surplus available in Salina Cruz that may help Japan diversify its supply sources of that product, he added. ABU DHABI TO REOPEN GULF OILFIELD HIT IN 1986 RAID Abu Dhabi\\'s offshore Abu al-Bukhoosh oilfield in the Gulf, shut since an aerial attack last November, will reopen when new anti-aircraft defences are ready, and this could be in the next two months, oil industry sources said. They said the Abu Dhabi government and Compagnie Francaise des Petroles (Total) &lt;TPN.PA>, whose Total Abu al-Bukhoosh subsidiary owns 51 pct of the field, have agreed on the reopening, but that a date has not been definitely fixed. Unidentified planes hit the field, 100 miles off Abu Dhabi, last November 25. The raid killed eight workers and destroyed the main living quarters and a bridge linking a wellhead to the main production platform. Western diplomats in the region say Iran was responsible but Tehran has blamed its Gulf War enemy Iraq. Abu al-Bukhoosh was producing 57,000 barrels per day (bpd) at the time of the attack, but the sources said it would resume at a maximum of half that level because of reduced staff and the fact only four of five wellheads were now operable. The sources said only 80 personnel can be housed in remaining accomodations, the sources said. Facilities being installed to protect the field include aircraft detection equipment, anti-aircraft missiles, housing for military personnel and helicopter landing pads, the sources said. Abu Dhabi is the largest oil producer in the United Arab Emirates, accounting for about 800,000 bpd of its total 1.15 mln bpd production, the sources said. They also said Iran was working to reopen its Sassan field, part of the same reservoir as Abu al-Bukhoosh and located only a few miles away. Sassan was heavily damaged by an Iraqi air raid only 10 days before Abu al-Bukhoosh was attacked. OIL ANALYST SEES PAPUA NEW GUINEA AS GOOD PROSPECT Papua New Guinea (PNG) provides the most exciting new prospect in the Asia-Pacific region for oil production, energy analyst Fereidun Fesharaki said here. The recent successful find at Iagifu is likely to put PNG on the list of major oil exporters by the early 1990s, he told the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association annual conference. Fesharaki, leader of the Energy Program at the East-West Center in Honolulu, Hawaii, was speaking on the Asia-Pacific petroleum outlook. With domestic demand of around 12,000 barrels per day (bpd) and prospects of production of over 100,000 bpd by late 1991, PNG would become an Ecuador-level crude exporter, Fesharaki said. The Iagifu wells in the Papuan Basin have recorded the best oil flows in more than 60 years of exploration in PNG. The PNG government\\'s Geological Survey in a paper distributed at the conference estimates Iagifu reserves at about 500 mln barrels. PNG enjoys the most liberal tax regime in the region with no secondary taxes, Fesharaki said. \"We expect a much larger oil search in Papua New Guinea, and discovery of much larger volumes of oil, similar in quality to (light) Bass Strait crude,\" Fesharaki said. There are also large pockets of high quality condensates to be produced, notably in the Juha field near Iagifu which is capable of producing 30,000 to 40,000 bpd, he said. But prices should be somewhat higher than the present levels to justify development of the Juha field, he said. The PNG Geological Survey paper noted there are five large prospective but little-explored sedimentary basins in PNG. NORWAY OFFERS 11TH LICENCE ROUND OFFSHORE BLOCKS Norway has offered 10 new offshore blocks to foreign and domestic applicants in the first phase of the country\\'s eleventh concession round, government officials said. Company shares in each of the licences proposed by the Oil and Energy Ministry are not final. The ministry has given the companies 10 days to accept or decline the proposed shares. French companies Ste Nationale Elf Aquitaine &lt;ELFP.PA> and Total Cie Francaise des Petroles &lt;TPN.PA>, which were expected to receive operatorships following France\\'s agreement last autumn to purchase gas from Norway\\'s Troll field, were not offered operatorships in this round, industry sources said. Three eleventh round blocks were awarded in the Haltenbanken exploration tract off central Norway, including the Smoerbukk West field where Den Norske Stats Oljeselskap A/S &lt;STAT.OL> (Statoil) was appointed operator. Statoil will share the licence with subsidiaries of U.S. Oil companies Tenneco Inc &lt;TGT.N> and Texas Eastern Corp &lt;TET.N> and the Italian oil company &lt;Agip SpA>\\'s Norwegian subsidiary. E.I. Du Pont de Nemours &lt;DD.N> subsidiary Conoco Norway Inc was named operator on Haltenbanken block 6406/8 and will share the licence with Statoil. Norsk Hydro A/S &lt;NHY.OL> will operate nearby block 6407/10 with partners Statoil, Norsk Agip A/S, Royal Dutch/Shell Group\\'s &lt;RD.AS> A/S Norske Shell and &lt;Deminex> unit Deminex (Norge) A/S. Statoil has been offered the operatorship on a new block in the relatively unexplored Moere South exploration area south of Haltenbanken, with A/S Norske Shell, Texas Eastern and &lt;Petroleo Brasileiro SA> (Petrobras) also offered stakes in the block. Norwegian companies landed operatorships on all six blocks opened in the Barents Sea area off northern Norway. The blocks were awarded in three licenses, each covering two blocks. Statoil will head exploration on blocks 7224/7 and 7224/8, sharing the licence with Exxon Corp\\'s &lt;XON.N> Norwegian subsidiary Esso Norge A/S, The British Petroleum Co PLC\\'s &lt;BP.L> BP Petroleum Development (Norway) Ltd, Shell, Norsk Hydro and Saga Petroleum A/S &lt;SAGP.OL>. Blocks 7219/9 and 7220/7 were awarded to Norsk Hydro, the operator, Statoil, Mobil Corp\\'s &lt;MOB.N> Mobil Exploration Norway, Petrofina SA\\'s &lt;PETB.BR> Norske Fina A/S and BP. The third Barents Sea licence, covering blocks 7124/3 and 7125/1, went to Saga Petroleum A/S, the operator, Statoil, Atlantic Richfield Co\\'s &lt;ARC.N> Arco Norge A/S, Total Marine Norge A/S and Amerada Hess Corp &lt;AHC.N>. The oil ministry withheld awards on four strategic blocks included in the eleventh round\\'s second phase. The ministry is accepting applications for phase two blocks until early April and the awards will likely be announced this summer, officials said. THATCHER DEFENDS UK OIL POLICY IN SAUDI INTERVIEW British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher denied in an interview published in Saudi Arabia today that her government\\'s oil policy contributed to weakness in world oil prices. She said the government was determined not to intervene to influence production decisions by oil companies operating in the North Sea. \"We believe these must be a matter for the commercial judgment of the oil companies,\" she told the Arabic language daily al-Sharq al-Awsat in an interview coinciding with a visit to London by King Fahd of Saudi Arabia. Thatcher said this policy had not contributed to the fall in oil prices as North Sea production was now about the same as in 1984 when prices were close to 30 dlrs a barrel. British production was on a plateau and was unlikely to increase in the future, she said. \"We naturally share the concern of Saudi Arabia and other OPEC members about the harmful effects of oil market volatility for both producer and consumer countries,\" Thatcher said. \"On our part, we are careful to avoid any actions which might add to such volatility.\" MOBIL PLAN TO OPEN PEKING OFFICE, CHINA DAILY SAYS Mobil Corp &lt;MOB.N> of the U.S. Plans to open an office in Peking to develop oil exploration opportunities in China, the China Daily said. It quoted Mobil president Richard Tucker, currently in Peking, as saying he is optimistic about investment prospects in China and that Peking will continue to encourage foreign private businesses to invest here. It said Mobil bought 73 mln dlrs of crude oil and oil products from China in 1986 and sold it lubricant and fertiliser, but gave no more details. ENERGY/U.S. OIL OUTPUT Energy Secretary John Herrington has proposed several ways to boost U.S. oil production, but he said all would cost the Treasury money and will come under close White House scrutiny before action is taken. One measure he said he favored would raise the depletion allowance to 27.5 pct on new oil and gas production as well as production using enhanced extraction methods. Herrington said such a plan would cost 200 mln dlrs a year. The White House, reacting, said it did not favor amending the tax code, but would look at the proposal. Herrington\\'s proposals to spur production were made along with the release last week of the energy department\\'s report on energy and the national security. The report said U.S. oil imports, rapidly rising, could hit 50 pct by the mid 1990s and have potentially damaging implications for national security. He has said since in speeches and at news conferences that any plan he would back to spur lagging domestic oil production would have to meet three criteria--increase production, not cause economic dislocation, and be low cost to the taxpayer. Herrington said an import fee would meet the first test, spurring production but fail the second and third. He said it would raise production and return 120,000 oil workers to their jobs, but at the same time it lifted oil prices, the higher prices would cost 400,000 jobs nationwide and cut the gross national product by 32 billion dlrs. A tax on gasoline, he said, would fail the first criteria by not increasing domestic production. In any case, U.S. officials say, President Reagan remains firmly opposed to an import fee and a gasoline tax. Options which meet Herrington\\'s criteria include: - Loan-price guarantees to shield banks from defaults by borrowers because of lower oil prices. It was estimated that if oil fell to five dlrs a barrel it could trigger defaults that could cost the government an estimated 15 billion dlrs. - A five pct tax credit for exploration and development. It would raise oil and gas production the equivalent of 325,000 barrels a day, at a cost of 740 mln dlrs a year. - A five pct credit only for geological and geophysical expenditures. It would increase production by 80,000 barrels a day, at a cost of 65 mln dlrs. - Lower bid minimums on outer continental shelf acreage to spur exploration. A drop from the present 150 dlrs per acre for the typical 5,760 acre tract to 25 dlrs per acre would lower the cost of the standard tract lease to 144,000 dlrs. Herrington also pressed anew for existing Administration proposals to deregulate natural gas, which he said would cut the need for imported oil by 300,000 barrels daily. He also called again for Congressional approval to explore off the continental shelf, which may hold more than 12 billion barrels of oil, and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, which may hold nine billion barrels. Herrington said he understood the Reagan\\'s reluctance to amend the newly enacted tax code to fund some of these proposals, but added he hoped his department\\'s energy/security study would make a strong case for the need to help the struggling domestic oil industry. Another move Herrington said he will press anew, even though it had been rejected earlier by the White House, is to raise the fill-rate for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to 100,000 barrels a day from its planned 1988 rate of 35,000. This, he said, would further bolster national security in case of an oil-supply disruption. CANADA SETS OIL INDUSTRY AID PACKAGE Canada\\'s federal government will provide a 350 mln dlr oil industry aid package that includes cash incentives designed to cover one-third of a company\\'s oil and gas exploration and development costs, Energy Minister Marcel Masse announced. The aid program will inject about 350 mln dlrs a year into the oil and gas industry and could lead to more than one billion dlrs in new investment, Masse told a news conference. The program will affect drilling done anywhere in Canada on or after April 1, 1987. Masse told reporters that the government\\'s oil industry aid package is aimed at small and medium sized companies. The aid package, called the Canadian Exploration and Development Incentive Program, will restrict the total payments that any individual company can claim to 10 mln dlrs a year. Masse said the program will probably generate new employment equivalent to 20,000 people working for a year. He said oil industry aid is needed because exploration and development spending dropped by at least 50 pct since world oil prices fell during the first half of 1986. Energy Minister Masse said the federal government decided to provide cash incentives so a large number of non-tax paying companies, mainly small Canadian firms, will receive the full value of the incentive. Such companies would not immediately benefit from tax benefits, he said. The federal government also wanted to deliver an aid program outside the tax system. Finance Minister Michael Wilson is now reviewing Canada\\'s tax system and plans to announce tax reform proposals later this spring. An important feature of the aid program is a decision to let companies issue flow-through shares, allowing investors to benefit from the subsidy rather than restricting benefits to only participating companies, he said. Allowing flow-through shares under the program will make it easier for companies to attract investors in exploration and development, Masse said. He told reporters his department is still considering whether to allow partnerships and other entities to qualify for the subsidy. MOBIL PLANS TO OPEN OFFICE IN PEKING Mobil Oil Corp of U.S. Plans to open an office in Peking to develop oil exploration opportunities in China, the China Daily said. It quoted Mobil president Richard Tucker, currently in Peking, as saying he is optimistic about investment prospects in China and that Peking will continue to encourage foreign private businesses to invest here. It said Mobil bought 73 mln dlrs of crude oil and oil products from China in 1986 and sold it lubricant and fertiliser, but gave no more details. OPEC WITHIN OUTPUT CEILING, SUBROTO SAYS Opec remains within its agreed output ceiling of 15.8 mln barrels a day, and had expected current fluctuations in the spot market of one or two dlrs, Indonesian Energy Minister Subroto said. He told reporters after meeting with President Suharto that present weakness in the spot oil market was the result of warmer weather in the U.S. And Europe which reduced demand for oil. Prices had also been forced down because refineries were using up old stock, he said. He denied that Opec was exceeding its agreed production ceiling. Asked what Opec\\'s output level was now, he replied: \"Below 15.8 (mln barrels per day).\" He did not elaborate. He said there appeared to have been some attempts to manipulate the market, but if all Opec members stick by the cartel\\'s December pricing agreement it would get through present price difficulties. He predicted that prices would recover again in the third and fourth quarters of 1987. He also reiterated that there was no need for an emergency Opec meeting. He said Opec had expected to see some fluctuations in the spot price. \"We hope the weak price will be overcome, and predict the price will be better in the third and fourth quarters.\" Refiners, he said, appeared to have used up old stock deliberately to cause slack demand in the market and the price to fall. But Opec would get through this period if members stuck together. ECUADOR NEGOTIATES WITH NIGERIA FOR LENDING OIL Earthquake-stricken Ecuador is negotiating with Nigeria to have the African country lend it 10,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude for export, Deputy Energy Minister Fernando Santos Alvite told Reuters. He said Ecuador was negotiating a shipments schedule and the terms of repaying the loan. Ecuador has suspended crude exports for about five months until it repairs a pipeline ruputured by a March five tremor. Santos Alvite added Ecuador is finalizing details for a program under which Venezuela would temporarily lend the country 50,000 bpd for export. TEXACO &lt;TX> RESERVES DOWN DESPITE LOWER OUTPUT Texaco Inc\\'s oil and gas reserves declined in 1986 despite reduced production and upward revisions in the company\\'s previous reserve estimates, its annual report said. The statement of the report\\'s auditor was qualified -- as was the previous one -- because of the unkonwn final impact of the judgement won by Pennzoil Co &lt;PZL> against Texaco on charges Texaco interfered with Pannzoil\\'s contract to acquire Getty Oil Co. The auditor\\'s point out, as Texaco has in the past, the company\\'s loss of any of several pending court decisions in this case could cause it \"to face prospects such as having to seek protection of its assets and business pursuant to the bankruptcy and reorganization provisions of Chapter 11\" of the federal bankruptcy code. Commenting on a Texas Court of Appeals ruling which reduced Pennzoil\\'s judgement by two billion dlrs, to 9.1 billion dlrs, Texaco said it will file a motion for a rehearing by the appeals court no later than March 30. Texaco said the proven crude oil reserves of the company and its consolidated subsidiaries totaled 2.54 billion barrels at the end of 1986, down from 2.69 billion a year earlier. However, inclusion of Texaco\\'s equity in the Eastern Hemisphere reserves of a nonsubsidiary company limited the decline to 2.91 billion barrels from 3.00 billion at the end of 1985. Worldwide production by the consolidated subsidiaries declined to 341 mln barrels last year from 362 mln in 1985 and upward revisions in previous reserve estimates rose to 143 mln barrels from 117 mln, respectively. Texaco said the largest drop in reserves came in the United States -- where the total dropped to 1.46 billion barrels from 1.55 billion. The company said U.S. liquids production averaged 660,000 barrels per day last year, down from 714,000 in 1985, with about 44 pct of the decline -- some 24,000 barrels per day -- representing high-cost production shut-in or curtailed in response to the decline in crude oil prices during 1986. Texaco said its natural gas reserves totaled 8.16 trillion cubic feet at year end, down from 8.87 trillion cubic feet at the end of 1985. EIA SAYS DISTILLATE STOCKS OFF 3.2 MLN BBLS, GASOLINE UP 2.2 MLN, CRUDE UP 7.5 MLN EIA SAYS DISTILLATE STOCKS OFF 3.2 MLN BBLS, GASOLINE UP 2.2 MLN, CRUDE UP 7.5 MLN RECENT U.S. OIL DEMAND UP 0.1 PCT FROM YEAR AGO U.S. oil demand as measured by products supplied rose 0.1 pct in the four weeks ended March 20 to 16.16 mln barrels per day from 16.15 mln in the same period a year ago, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) said. In its weekly petroleum status report, the Energy Department agency said distillate demand was off 0.1 pct in the period to 3.258 mln bpd from 3.260 mln a year earlier. Gasoline demand averaged 6.72 mln bpd, off 1.2 pct from 6.80 mln last year, while residual fuel demand was 1.38 mln bpd, off 2.1 pct from 1.41 mln, the EIA said. Domestic crude oil production was estimated at 8.35 mln bpd, down 7.8 pct from 9.06 mln a year ago, and gross daily crude imports (excluding those for the SPR) averaged 3.44 mln bpd, up 16.3 pct from 2.95 mln, the EIA said. Refinery crude runs in the four weeks were 11.90 mln bpd, up 1.4 pct from 11.74 mln a year earlier, it said. In the first 78 days of the year, refinery runs were up 1.8 pct to an average 12.25 mln bpd from 12.04 mln in the year-ago period, the EIA said. Year-to-date demand for all petroleum products averaged 16.32 mln bpd, up 1.8 pct from 16.04 mln in 1986, it said. So far this year, distillate demand rose 0.1 pct to 3.31 mln bpd from 3.30 mln in 1986, gasoline demand was 6.60 mln bpd, up 0.1 pct from 6.59 mln, and residual fuel demand fell 0.4 pct to 1.42 mln bpd from 1.43 mln, the EIA said. Year-to-date domestic crude output was estimated at 8.41 mln bpd, off 7.7 pct from 9.11 mln a year ago, while gross crude imports averaged 3.96 mln bpd, up 28.1 pct from 3.09 mln, it said. UNOCAL &lt;UCL> PLANS INCREASE IN CAPITAL SPENDING Unocal Corp said it intends to increase its spending for capital projects to 929 mln dlrs in 1987, eight pct more than the 862 mln spent in 1986. The company said in its annual report that it would increase spending for exploration and development of petroleum resources by about three pct to 614 mln dlrs from 1986\\'s 595 mln dlrs, assuming oil prices hold around current levels. The planned spending for exploration and production in 1987 remains well below the 1.1 billion dlrs spent in 1985, Unocal said. The company\\'s proved developed and undeveloped reserves of crude oil rose slightly in 1986, Unocal said. Net crude oil and condensate reserves were 752 mln bbls as of Dec 31, 1986, compared to 751 mln bbls at the end of 1985, Unocal said. The company said its net crude oil and condensate production averaged 248,200 barrels per day in 1986 compared to 251,300 bpd in 1985. Unocal said its worldwide natural gas reserves were 6.07 billion cubic feet in 1986 compared to 1985\\'s 6.19 billion. Net natural gas output averaged 976 mln cubic feet per day in 1986, down 10 pct from 1985\\'s 1,084 mln, the company said. Unocal said its average sales prices for crude oil was 12.67 dlrs a barrel worldwide in 1986 compared to 23.81 dlrs in 1985, and its average sales price for natural gas was 2.03 dlrs per thousand cubic feet in 1986 against 2.24 dlrs in 1985. Average production costs for crude oil and natural gas declined nearly 30 pct to 3.41 dlrs per bbl of oil equivalent in 1986 from 4.81 dlrs in 1985, Unocal said. In the annual report, the company called for imposition of an oil import fee by the U.S. government to set a floor price of about 25 dlrs a barrel for crude oil. \"Simply stabilizing prices at about 18 dlrs per barrel will not materialy slow the drop in U.S. production or the rise in imports,\" Chairman Fred Hartley said in the annual report. \"Without decisive action in Washington, this nation will once again become a hostage to OPEC\\'s plans and policies,\" Hartley said. PENNZOIL (PZL) WILLING TO SETTLE TEXACO (TX) LAWSUIT Pennzoil Co said it had not yet received any \"meaningful settlement offer\" from Texaco Inc but added that the company remained willing to consider proposals to settle the 10.2 billion dlr jury judgment it won against Texaco. In its newly-released annual report to shareholders, Pennzoil said it expected the Texas state court judgment, which was upheld by a state appeals court on February 12, to be upheld if appealed again. \"To date, Pennzoil has yet to receive any meaningful settlement offer from Texaco, though it remains open to any realistic effort to settle the matter,\" Pennzoil chairman Hugh Liedtke said in the annual report. Pennzoil also said it had budgeted 212 mln dlrs for capital spending in 1987, a drop from the 233 mln dlrs spent last year. Proved U.S. and foreign reserves of natural gas declined to 964 billion cubic feet last year, from 1.01 trillion cubic feet in 1985, because of a virtual halt in its exploration program, Pennzoil said. Its crude oil reserves dropped to 140 mln barrels from 158 mln barrels in 1985. The Houston-based company said it sold an average of 339 mln cubic feet of domestic natural gas each day last year, a 17 pct drop from 1985. The average sales price for gas dropped by 60 cents per mcf to 2.16 dlrs per mcf, Pennzoil said. U.S. crude oil and gas liquids production last year fell to an average of 33,290 barrels per day from 34,102 barrels per day in 1985. The company\\'s total revenues in 1986 declined to 482.3 mln dlrs, from 762.5 mln dlrs the previous year. Operating income in 1986 fell more than 80 pct, to 38.0 mln dlrs. Pennzoil said its goals for 1987 included development of its Point Arguello oilfield off the California coast, to maintain current production levels in its Bluebell-Altamont Field in Utah and to drill for prospects in the Gulf of Mexico\\'s Mobile Bay area. \"Production should begin late in the year from the Harvest Platform in the Santa Maria Basin offshore California,\" the company said. \"Pennzoil\\'s share of this production initially should be five thousand barrels a day, increasing to a peak of 15 thousand barrels a day, net, by 1989.\" In its sulphur business, Pennzoil said production totaled 2.1 mln long tons last year, a decline of 18 pct from 1985. The average sales price also declined, to 138.25 dlrs per long ton from 141.05 dlrs in 1985. \"The long term outlook for our sulphur operations remains bright,\" the company said. \"We expect sulphur\\'s pricing structure to strengthen during the current year, probably in the third and fourth quarters.\" LATIN OIL PRODUCERS TO MEET IN CARACAS Five regional oil producing nations will gather in Caracas tommorrow for a two-day meeting expected to center on ways to combat proposals for a U.S. tax on imported petroleum, the Venezuela\\'s ministry of energy and mines said. Oil ministers from Mexico, Trinidad and Tobago, Ecuador and Venezuela will be on hand for the fifth meeting of the informal group of Latin American and Caribbean Petroleum Exporters, formed in 1983, it said. Colombia will also attend for the first time, as an observer nation, the ministry said. Energy and Mines Minister Arturo Hernandez Grisanti said the conference has no set agenda but one entire session Friday will be devoted to proposals for a tax on imported oil. Two of the group\\'s members, Venezuela and Mexico, are second and third largest foreign suppliers of oil to the United States, respectively, following Canada. Venezuela, concerned about the effect such a tax would have on its exports, undertook a diplomatic push to coordinate strategy against such measures. In February, Canadian Energy Minister Marcel Masse was invited to Caracas for talks with Hernandez on proposals for an oil import tax. GULF ESCORTS STILL UNDER DISCUSSION - WEINBERGER No action has been taken yet on the Reagan Adminstration\\'s offer to escort Kuwaiti oil tankers through the Gulf, but the issue is being discussed, U.S. Secretary of Defence Caspar Weinberger said. The offer was made to Kuwait in light of Iran\\'s deployment of Chinese-built missiles to cover the entrance to the Gulf. Weinberger told reporters prior to a speech at Texas Christian University that he did not think Iran and the United States were moving towards a potential conflict, adding that the Straits of Hormuz at the mouth of the Gulf were still \"free water.\" GULF ESCORTS STILL UNDER DISCUSSION - WEINBERGER No action has been taken yet on the Reagan Adminstration\\'s offer to escort Kuwaiti oil tankers through the Gulf, but the issue is being discussed, U.S. Secretary of Defence Caspar Weinberger said.

KOREA MAY BUY U.S. OIL TO AID TRADE BALANCE South Korea is studying a plan to buy more coal from the United States and to start importing Alaskan crude oil to help reduce its huge trade surplus with the United States, Energy Ministry officials said today. They said the plan would dominate discussions at two-day energy talks between officials of the two countries in Washington from April 1. Huh Sun-yong, who will attend the talks with three other Seoul government officials, told Reuters that Seoul was \"positively considering buying a certain amount of Alaskan oil beginning this year as part of our government\\'s overall plan to reduce a widening trade gap between the two countries.\" Huh said however that South Korean refineries considered the Alaskan oil economically uncompetitive. BP OIL RAISES OPERATING PROFIT &lt;BP Oil Ltd>, the U.K. Marketing and refining arm of British Petroleum Co Plc &lt;BP.L>, raised its pretax operating profit on a replacement cost basis to 182 mln stg in calendar 1986, compared with 66 mln stg in 1985. Sales and operating revenue fell to 3.1 billion stg from 4.2 billion on a replacement cost basis. Historical cost operating profit was 61 mln stg, up from 16 mln. BP Oil said 1985 profits had been depressed by exceptional items. Its profit figures were stated before interest charges. Chief executive David Kendall said improved results mirrored benefits of a restructuring program undertaken in recent years. However, he warned future financial pressure on the industry will be severe. \"The U.K. Oil marketing and refining industry will need to invest larger sums - probably around 500 mln stg a year - for a good many years,\" he said in a statement. WALL STREET STOCKS/U.S. OIL COMPANIES British Petroleum Co PLC\\'s announcement that its U.S. subsidiary intends to tender for the 45 pct of Standard Oil Co &lt;SRD> it does not already own, catapulted U.S. oil stocks sharply higher this morning, traders and analysts said. \"It raises the specter of additional consolidation in the industry and that is what is boosting the other oils,\" analyst Rosario Ilacqua of L.F.

Margoshes said the BP action \"is an articulation of the underlying value of oil companies in the marketplace.\" But he expressed skepticism that this will necessarily lead to heightened merger or buyout activity in the oil group. BRITISH, FRENCH MINISTERS DISCUSS PUBLIC SPENDING French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur discussed the need to control public spending in talks here today with British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson, a Treasury spokesman said. The spokesman said the ministers reviewed their economies, and public spending, domestic and European Community-wide. He declined to comment on whether the subject of concerted action to shore up the dollar had arisen. The U.S. Currency dipped sharply earlier this week after a month of relative stability after an agreement by six major industrialised nations in Paris on February 22 to stabilise their currencies. FED\\'S HELLER SAYS DOLLAR\\'S CURRENT LEVEL IS APPROPRIATE FED\\'S HELLER SAYS DOLLAR\\'S CURRENT LEVEL IS APPROPRIATE U.K. MONEY MARKET GIVEN FURTHER 437 MLN STG HELP The Bank of England said it had provided the money market with a further 437 mln stg assistance in the afternoon session. This brings the Bank\\'s total help so far today to 461 mln stg and compares with its revised shortage forecast of 450 mln stg. The central bank made purchases of bank bills outright comprising 120 mln stg in band one at 10-7/8 pct and 315 mln stg in band two at 10-13/16 pct. In addition, it also bought two mln stg of treasury bills in band two at 10-13/16 pct. FED\\'S HELLER SAYS DOLLAR\\'S LEVEL IS APPROPRIATE Federal Reserve Board governor Robert Heller said that the dollar\\'s current level is appropriate but declined to comment on widespread market reports of concerted central bank intervention this week. \"The dollar is stable again... The current level is the appropriate level,\" Heller told reporters after a speech to a meeting of financial services analysts. He said last month\\'s six-nation currency accord in Paris did not include target ranges for the dollar in an \"academic way.\" Heller also said that it was too early to determine whether the parties to the six-nation accord were taking appropriate steps to carry out the longer-term economic adjustments agreed to in Paris. \"Clearly, they\\'ve not been implemented yet... No one expects implementation within a week or two,\" he said. Earlier today, U.S. Treasury assistant secretary told a Senate banking subcommittee that he did not believe that West Germany and Japan have yet carried out their international responsibilities. PARIS G-6 MEET SET NO TARGETS - LEIGH-PEMBERTON Bank of England Governor Robin Leigh-Pemberton said the Paris pact agreed between six leading industrialised nations set no nominal exchange rate targets. Leigh-Pemberton said in oral evidence to a select committee that \"we did not swap numbers - we reached an understanding\" on how to cooperate towards stabilizing currencies at around their current levels. He said the accord had brought Britain into a form of joint currency float - but one which let it still purse an independent monetary policy. \"I would concede that, since the Louvre Accord, we are acting as if we are in something,\" Leigh-Pemberton said. \"The Louvre and Plaza accords show there is a very effective role for the (Group of) seven central banks to operate together\" towards stabilising exchange rates,\" Leigh-Pemberton said. He did not mention this week\\'s intervention by central banks to support the dollar, after markets decided to test the accord. Leigh-Pemberton said that \"the effectiveness of this (cooperation) is actually larger than many of us had thought in the pre-Plaza days\" before September 1985. He did not indicate what exchange rate levels were broadly sought by the six nations, and noted that \"we are more effective in our agreement if we can leave the markets guessing.\" He did not indicate what exchange rate levels were broadly sought by the six nations, and noted that \"we are more effective in our agreement if we can leave the markets guessing.\" Leigh-Pemberton said that, in principle, the Bank of England favoured full EMS membership for sterling, provided such a move did not endanger U.K. Anti-inflation monetary policy. Asked whether he wanted to see U.K. Interest rates lower, he said \"the two half point cuts (this month in banks\\' base lending rates) have been appropriate up until now.\" Leigh-Pemberton said he preferred a \"cautious step-by-step approach\" to reducing short term interest rates, not least because \"we have a potential problem with inflation.\" Underlying U.K. Inflation was currently around 4.0 pct, \"one of the highest\" among industrialised nations, he added. Leigh-Pemberton said the Bank of England had not wanted base rates to fall before the unveiling of the 1987/88 budget on March 17, but he said pressure from financial markets for such a move had proved irresistible. Base rates are now at 10 pct. Regarding sterling\\'s relationship with oil, Leigh-Pemberton said that the pound could be seen being undervalued overall. He said the current oil price of some 18 dlrs a barrel might suggest a level of 74 on the Bank of England\\'s sterling index, when compared with the index\\'s level before oil prices dropped from around the 30 dlr level. The index, base 1975, closed here today at 72.1, unchanged from the previous close. 26-MAR-1987 26-MAR-1987 FORMER HERSTATT DEALER CAN BE SUED, COURT RULES The former chief currency dealer of Herstatt Bank, which collapsed in 1974 on foreign exchange speculation in West Germany\\'s biggest banking crash, can stand trial for damages, a court ruled. The court overturned a claim by Danny Dattel that a case for damages should not be allowed after such a long interval. Herstatt creditors are seeking 12.5 mln marks from Dattel, whom they accuse of causing losses at the bank of over 500 mln marks by manipulating forward foreign exchange contracts. The crash of the private Herstatt bank with losses of over one billion marks stunned West Germany\\'s business community, and led to a tightening of banking regulations. The losses were even greater than the 480 mln marks announced recently by Volkswagen as a result of fraud in currency transactions. Ivan Herstatt, managing director of the bank when it collapsed, was sentenced to four and a half years in prison in 1984 but appealed. Six other people associated with the bank were jailed in 1983. But Dattel was freed from prosecution after he produced medical evidence of paranoia caused by Nazi persecution during his childhood, which might have led him to take his own life.

Foreign exchange dealers said the yen funds would be used to buy dollars, to prevent a further dollar fall. The government sources said the amount, covering the first 50 days of the year starting April 1, accounts for more than 90 pct of the 16,000 billion yen in bills incorporated in the full budget. U.K. MONEY MARKET DEFICIT FORECAST AT 700 MLN STG The Bank of England said it forecast a shortage of around 700 mln stg in the money market today. Among the main factors affecting liquidity, bills maturing in official hands will drain some 501 mln stg while a rise in note circulation and bankers\\' balances below target will take out around 285 mln stg and 45 mln stg respectively. Partly offsetting these outflows, exchequer transactions will add some 120 mln stg to the system today. Bank of France buying dollars for yen - banking sources Bank of France buying dollars for yen - banking sources Bundesbank bought dollars against yen in Frankfurt - dealers Bundesbank bought dollars against yen in Frankfurt - dealers ITALIAN 1987 GDP GROWTH FORECAST AT THREE PCT Italy\\'s gross domestic product (GDP) will grow three pct in real terms this year and 2.7 pct in 1988, said economic information company Data Resources Europe Inc (DRI). Michel Girardin, DRI Europe\\'s senior economist, said at a conference that Italian GDP growth this year \"will be mainly driven by consumption and especially investment.\" Girardin said the driving force behind GDP growth next year will shift from domestic demand to exports as a result of expected depreciation of the lira against the major currencies. Italy\\'s budget ministry said yesterday that GDP rose 2.7 pct in real terms in 1986. DRI forecast that inflation, which was an average 6.3 pct in 1986, will be under five pct this year and that interest rates should drop two pct. Girardin said the lira is expected to appreciate 14 pct against the dollar this year following last year\\'s 22 pct appreciation. An expected German mark appreciation against the dollar means that the lira should lose about six pct of its value relative to the German currency, he said. DRI estimates that foreign demand for Italian products should grow by a 3.2 pct this year following last year\\'s 6.2 pct increase. ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - DUTCH EXCHANGE RATE POLICY Recent slackness on Dutch capital markets has led some bankers to question the Central Bank\\'s policy of pegging the guilder firmly to the West German mark and to ask for more flexiblility in exchange rate policy. While agreeing with the Bank\\'s commitment to defend the guilder strongly, some bankers want the Bank to make more use of the range within which the guilder and the mark can fluctuate against each other in the European Monetary System (EMS). Roelof Nelissen, chairman of Amsterdam-Rotterdam Bank NV (Amro) said the Central Bank\\'s policy was overcautious. \"I would like to suggest that the Bank use more freely the range given to the guilder in the EMS,\" Nelissen said at the presentation of Amro\\'s 1986 annual report last week. Within the EMS, the mark is allowed to fluctuate against the guilder between 110.1675 and 115.235 guilders per 100. The Central Bank maintains a stricter policy and tries to keep the mark below the 113.00 guilders per 100. It regards a stable exchange rate as its main target, using interest rate policies to influence the exchange rate. The preference of exchange rate goals above interest rate aims goes almost undisputed in the Netherlands. Critics say the Bank keeps the reins unnecessarily short. Rabobank Nederland said in its latest economic bulletin: \"By maintaining the 113.00 limit, the Central Bank raises the expectation it will always intervene above that level. If it suddenly needs more flexibility it will find it very hard to obtain.\" Amro\\'s Nelissen said relatively small changes in interest rates and exchange rates could cause substantial flows of securities business and sharp fluctuations on the Dutch capital market. Large interest rate changes were often needed to bring about small changes in the guilder/mark exchange rate, he added. Unlike Amro, Algemene Bank Nederland NV (ABN) says this is a price the Dutch have to pay. It fully agrees with the Central Bank\\'s policy, director-general Julien Geertsema told Reuters, noting a 1983 decision not to revalue the guilder fully with the mark in the EMS hurt confidence in the Dutch currency. \"It is a pity we need such a wide interest rate difference between West Germany to maintain the exchange rate,\" he added. Interest rate differentials between West Germany and the Netherlands are the main factors that trigger capital flows between the two countries, as the economic performance of the two does not differ much, economists said. Data on 1986 capital flows between West Germany and the Netherlands have not yet been released, but in 1985 they accounted for only 10 pct of total trade flows between the two countries, put at 110 billion guilders for 1986 by the Dutch-German Chamber of Commerce earlier this month. Economists say capital flows are more sensitive to interest and exchange rates. West Germany is the Netherlands\\' largest single trading partner, taking 28 pct of Dutch exports and providing 26 pct of imports in the last quarter of 1986, Central Bureau of Statistics figures show. At the moment, the rates for three month euromark deposits trade around 4.0 pct while the same deposits in guilders have a rate of around 5-7/16 pct. Amro bank argues that the Dutch real interest rate will even rise further because of expectations of deflation here in 1987, contrasting with slight inflation in West Germany. In the Netherlands, the cost of living is expected to decrease by 1.5 pct at a GNP growth rate of two pct, the Dutch Central Planning Agency said in its 1987 forecast last month. German GNP is seen rising by two to 2.5 pct, but with inflation between zero and 1.0 pct, according to most German forecasts. But despite this upward push on real Dutch rates, money dealers do not expect the Central Bank to cut official rates independently without prior moves by the Bundesbank. Following the West German interest rate cuts on January 22, the Dutch Central Bank did not lower its rates but set a 0.5 pct lower tariff for special advances and abandoned its credit surcharge. Most traders were surprised by this move as they had expected the Bank to follow suit unconditionally, they said. The Bank said it lowered the rate with the largest impact on the money market as far as the exchange rate permitted. While not entirely unsympathetic to critics of its policies, the Central Bank keeps its grip firm and the range narrow. \"The European Monetary System is not only a relationship between the guilder and the mark. Many times widening of the margin between the two would implicate we have to buy or sell large amounts of a third currency,\" Central Bank vice-director Jan-Hendrik Du Marchie Sarvaas said. \"If we allowed the guilder to become a little cheaper, the markets would start to believe it was weak. We don\\'t want that. We want to make clear that the guilder is just as strong as the mark,\" he said. BANK OF SPAIN SUSPENDS ASSISTANCE The Bank of Spain suspended its daily money market assistance obliging borrowers to take funds from the second window, where on Wednesday rates were raised to 16 pct compared with 14 pct for normal overnight funds. Money market sources said in view of high borrower demand the suspension was likely to remain in effect until April 3, the start of the next 10-day accounting period for reserve requirements. The suspension comes after the Bank yesterday gave 1,145 billion pesetas assistance, a record high for this year. It said 90 billion pesetas was provided at the second window. U.K. MONEY MARKET GIVEN 265 MLN STG ASSISTANCE The Bank of England said it provided the money market with 265 mln stg in assistance this morning. This compares with the bank\\'s estimate of the shortage in the system of 750 mln stg, earlier revised up from 700 mln. The central bank purchased bank bills outright comprising 119 mln stg in band one at 9-7/8 pct, 144 mln stg in band two at 9-13/16 pct and two mln stg in band three at 9-3/4 pct. BANK OF JAPAN INTERVENES TO STEM DOLLAR FALL The Bank of Japan intervened in the market to keep the dollar above 149 yen but the unit was under strong selling pressure by an investment trust, dealers said. The central bank stepped into the market when the dollar fell towards 149.00 yen, but a trust bank aggressively sold dollars to hedge currency risks, and the Bank intervened again at 149.00, they said. The trust bank apparently changed its earlier view that the dollar would rise and started selling relatively large amounts of dollars, pushing the unit down to 148.80 at one point, brokers said. One dealer estimated that the Bank bought 400 mln to 500 mln dlrs as it tried to keep the U.S. Currency above 149 yen. BANK OF FRANCE AGAIN BUYING DOLLARS, SOURCES SAY The Bank of France intervened in the Paris foreign exchange market this morning for the third successive day, banking sources said. Like yesterday, it bought dollars and sold yen in small amounts, they said. One dealer said it was seen in the market twice in early dealing, buying five mln dlrs each time. Other dealers also reported small-scale intervention to stabilise the dollar after aggressive selling overnight in Tokyo, where the Bank of Japan also intervened again. The dollar steadied at around 6.0650/0700 francs after easing in early trading to 6.0615/35 from an opening 6.0700/50. It closed yesterday at 6.0800/30. One major french bank said it bought 10 mln dlrs for the central bank, selling yen, within a trading range of 148.20/30 yen to the dollar, compared with yesterday\\'s 149.28 rate at which intervention was carried out here. The yen later firmed to around 147.90/148.00. BUNDESBANK BOUGHT DOLLARS AGAINST YEN, DEALERS SAY The Bundesbank entered the open market in the late morning to buy dollars against yen in concert with the Bank of France, dealers said. The Bundesbank came into the market when the dollar was around 148.10 yen just after it had fallen below 148 to touch 147.80 at 1027 GMT. The move had little effect, with the dollar still testing 148 yen ahead of the official fixing. Dealers said the intervention was for fairly small amounts, in contrast to the Bundesbank\\'s activity on Wednesday when dealers reported it bought about 100 mln dlrs. The Bundesbank had no comment. JAPAN SETS ASIDE YEN FUNDS TO PREVENT DLR FALL The 50-day provisional 1987/88 budget, adopted today by the government, allows the Finance Ministry to issue up to 14,600 billion yen worth of foreign exchange fund financing bills, government sources said. Foreign exchange dealers said the yen funds would be used to buy dollars, to prevent a further dollar fall. The government sources said the amount, covering the first 50 days of the year starting April 1, accounts for more than 90 pct of the 16,000 billion yen in bills incorporated in the full budget. BANK OF FRANCE BUYS DOLLARS AT PARIS FIXING - DEALERS BANK OF FRANCE BUYS DOLLARS AT PARIS FIXING - DEALERS swiss national bank says bought dollars against yen swiss national bank says bought dollars against yen SWISS NATIONAL BANK SAYS IT BOUGHT DOLLARS The Swiss National Bank bought dollars against yen today, a spokesman for the bank said. He declined to say how many dollars the bank bought or when precisely it intervened. Swiss foreign exchange dealers described the National Bank\\'s purchases as modest, perhaps amounting to no more than 20 or 30 mln dlrs. The Bank of France, which was reported buying dollars against the yen in Paris, had made inquiries with Swiss banks as well, and the Bundesbank had also intervened. Bank of Japan dollar purchases today were perhaps 1.2 to 1.5 billion dlrs. Dealers said this tended to confirm the market\\'s impression that major industrial countries had agreed at the Paris meeting on an effective floor for the dollar of 148 yen, and the market seemed ready to test it. Commercial clients were also selling dollars against the yen as the end of the Japanese fiscal year on March 31 drew closer. Today\\'s dealings in spot currencies are booked for March 31. One dealer said he had the feeling Japanese companies had been asked by the Bank of Japan not to sell dollars at this point, but some, while sticking to the letter of that request, were offering dollars forward today, rather than lose out if the dollar fell further. The run on the dollar against the yen came in a market thinned by the absence of many dealers for a Forex Club meeting in Hamburg. Trading was, in fact, rather light against currencies other than the yen, the dollar holding little changed through the day. The market now expected the U.S. Federal Reserve to intervene in support of the dollar. \"But they will probably do it only half-heartedly, so I don\\'t think it will matter too much on rates,\" one dealer said. U.K. MONEY MARKET GIVEN FURTHER 663 MLN STG HELP The Bank of England said it gave the money market a further 663 mln stg assistance in the afternoon session. This takes the Bank\\'s total assistance so far today to 928 mln stg and compares with its forecast shortage which it earlier revised up to 850 mln stg from 750 mln. The central bank purchased bills in band one at 9-7/8 pct comprising 267 mln stg bank bills, four mln stg local authority bills and one mln stg treasury bills. It also bought 378 mln stg bank bills and 13 mln stg of treasury bills in band two at 9-13/16 pct. AUSTRIA DOES NOT INTERVENE TO SUPPORT DOLLAR The Austrian National Bank did not intervene on the foreign exchange markets today to support the dollar, deputy banking department chief Herbert Danzinger told Reuters. He denied a suggestion by a dealer at one Vienna bank that the National Bank had sold marks to support the U.S. Currency. Senior dealers at Creditanstalt and Girozentrale, Austria\\'s two largest banks, said they would have been aware of any National Bank intervention. Any dollar purchases by the Bank today were for purely day-to-day purposes, they said. DEALERS SAY FED INTERVENED BUYING DOLLARS IN U.S. U.S. dealers said the New York Federal Reserve Bank has intervened in the foreign exchange market today buying dollars against yen. Fed officials do not comment on such intervention, but dealers said it appeared that the Fed had intervened when the dollar reached 147.50 yen in New York. The dollar subsequently hovered at 147.55/65 yen. Dealers said they were uncertain about the size of the intervention, but some said it was only for a small amount. They were also uncertain whether the Fed intervened on its own account, or if it executed orders for the Bank of Japan. FED ADDS RESERVES VIA CUSTOMER REPURCHASES The Federal Reserve entered the U.S. Government securities market to arrange one billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreements, a Fed spokesman said. Dealers said Federal funds were trading at 6-1/8 pct when the Fed began its temporary and indirect supply of reserves to the banking system. TALKING POINT/GOLD The price of gold bullion and share prices of North American gold stocks are benefiting from continued weakness in the U.S. dollar, analysts said. \"There\\'s been a tug of war between the (currency) speculators and the central banks over the U.S. dollar and it looks like the game has gone to the speculators,\" said John Ing at Maison Placements Canada Inc. The dollar remained close to post-World War II lows today against the Japanese yen despite buying by several central banks, including the Federal Reserve, dealers said. A drop in the dollar means uncertainty and gold is the traditional hedge against uncertainty, Ing noted. Another analyst, Richard Cohen at Brown Baldwin Nisker Ltd, noted that \"a lot of foreign investors are holding U.S. dollars. If they see they are losing money, they move back into gold.\" A dollar decline also has inflationary implications, Ing said, adding that Maison Placements sees inflation rising to a four pct annual rate from the current level of about three pct. Ing predicts gold will peak at 510 dlrs this year from its current level of about 416 dlrs per ounce. Cohen sees an average price of 425 dlrs, and another analyst, Michael Pickens, at Yorkton Securities, puts the average at 450 dlrs, with a possible spike above 500 dlrs. However, gold stocks in the U.S. and Canada have risen far faster in recent months than the price of the metal itself, causing concern among analysts that a correction lies somewhere in the future. But for now, all analysts say there is no sign the buying pressure is slowing down. \"The stocks have run an incredible way,\" Cohen said. On U.S. markets today, ASA Ltd &lt;ASA> rose 4-1/8 to 61-1/2, Campbell Red Lake Mines &lt;CRK> was up 1-3/8 and Newmont Gold &lt;NGC> increased 1-1/2 to 31-1/4. The Toronto Stock Exchange gold index today was up 268 points at 8067.90. Hemlo Gold gained 1-1/4 at 26-3/4, LAC Minerals was up 1-5/8 at 41, Placer Development rose 1-1/4 at 43-3/8 and Lacana Mining gained 1 at 18. Ing pointed out that the TSE gold index has gained 51 pct since December 31, 1986, while the price of bullion has increased six pct. \"Canadian golds have been the top performing index this year,\" he noted. In the U.S., there is \"too much money chasing too few stocks,\" Pickens said. And many investing institutions such as pension funds and insurance companies still have excess cash, he added. Cohen also noted that today\\'s silver price break through six dlrs an ounce indicates small investors are entering the precious metals market and he expects the ratio between gold and silver prices to narrow. TAIWAN TO STUDY SUSPENDING FOREX CONTROLS Premier Yu Kuo-Hua ordered financial officials to quicken the pace of relaxing foreign exchange controls and study the possibility of suspending the controls, a cabinet statement said. The statement quoted Yu as telling Finance Ministy and Central Bank officials the relaxation was needed to help reduce Taiwan\\'s surging foreign exchange reserves, which reached a record 53 billion U.S. Dollars this month. Finance Minister Robert Chien told reporters his ministry and the Central Bank would work jointly on new measures to ease the controls, but he did not give details. Yu said the government could maintain the framework of the foreign exchange controls while finding ways to ease them. The controls would be used during emergency. Taiwan\\'s reserves have resulted largely from its trade surplus, which hit 15.6 billion dlrs in 1986 and 10.6 billion in 1985. About 95 pct of the surplus was from Taiwan\\'s trade with the United States, according to official figures. But he said that while easing the controls would help reduce the reserves, it would not do so substantially in a short time. Economists and bankers said the new decision resulted from growing pressure from the United States, Taiwan\\'s largest trading partner, which buys almost half the island\\'s exports. Lu Ming-Jen, economic professor at Soochow University, told Reuters: \"The decision came a little bit late. But it was better than never.\" Ko Fei-Lo, Vice President at First Commercial Bank, said the government should rapidly relax its foreign exchange controls and open its market wider to help balance trade with its trading partners, especially the United States. \"The liberalisation in both imports and foreign exchange controls will not only help our trading partners, but also help our own economic problems,\" he said. He said the mounting foreign exchange reserveshelped boost Taiwan\\'s money supply by 48.22 pct in the year to end-February. U.S. BANKER PREDICTS FURTHER DOLLAR FALL THIS YEAR A leading U.S. Banker said the dollar was likely to fall another five to 10 pct this year and an improvement in the huge American trade deficit would be only temporary at current world exchange rate levels. Kurt Viermetz, Worldwide Treasurer of &lt;Morgan Guaranty Trust Co>, told Arab currency traders meeting here that the steady depreciation of the dollar had not gone far enough to rein in U.S. Deficits on a lasting basis. Speaking at the 14th annual congress of the Interarab Cambist Association, Viermetz said an agreement reached last month among major industrial nations to steady the dollar around current levels left many questions unanswered. \"I cannot see any chance for a real turnaround (rise) in the dollar,\" Viermetz said. \"I believe there is room for a further fall of five to 10 per cent in 1987.\" The United States, West Germany, Japan, France, Great Britain and Canada -- G-6 -- agreed in Paris in late February to stabilise major currencies around current levels. The accord came after months of transatlantic argument, with Tokyo and Bonn claiming Washington\\'s policy of talking the dollar lower had made life impossible for West German and Japanese exporters. The Paris accord also brought a pause to the continued slide of the dollar engineered by a meeting in New York in September 1985 when industrial nations agreed to depress the value of the currency to help redress global trade imbalances. But Viermetz said Morgan Guaranty\\'s economic models showed that with no further change in exchange rates -- and continued sluggish growth in West Germany and Japan -- the U.S. Trade deficit would improve only temporarily. He said the deficit might fall to 145 billion dlrs this year from 165 billion in 1986 and further improve to 120 billion in 1988 but by 1990, it would be back around 160 billion dlrs. \"This is clearly unacceptable for the monetary authorities and politicians in Washington,\" he said. Viermetz said it was only natural that markets should attempt to test the credibility of the Paris accord, struck when the dollar was trading at about 1.83 marks and 152.50 yen. Immediately before the historic 1985 New York agreement or \"Plaza Accord,\" the dollar had been trading at 2.84 marks and 240 yen. Viermetz said he believed major nations in Paris wanted to see the dollar hold within a \"loose range\" of 1.75 to 1.90 marks and 145 to 155 yen, with any attempt to push the U.S. Currency lower being countered by central bank intervention. The dollar ended in New York yesterday at 147.15/25 yen -- its lowest level against the Japanese currency in roughly 40 years. It closed at 1.8160/70 marks. Viermetz also said he did not see the U.S. Federal funds rate falling below six pct for fear of provoking an uncontrolled fall in the dollar. But at the same time, worries about the international debt crisis would mean there was little chance of a rise above 6-3/4 pct since this would increase loan costs to the third world. The Middle East foreign exchange conference brings together more than 200 traders and bank treasury chiefs from the Arab world and Arab banks in European and U.S. Financial centres. Formal discussions, which end today, have also centred on the role of Arab banks in world financial markets, with bankers urging them to adapt to a new global trend towards securitisation of  business. Hikmat Nashashibi, President of the Arab Bankers Association, said Arab banks have to shake off their old mentality of commercial banking and concentrate more on investment banking. OFFICIAL WANTS ARAB FUND TO HELP LEBANESE POUND Lebanese central bank Vice Governor Meguerditch Bouldikian called for the establishment of an Arab fund to assist the Lebanese pound, which has lost more than 80 pct of its value against the dollar since January 1986. Bouldikian told an Arab exchange dealers conference the bank would continue to take measures to defend the currency. But he said Lebanon needed foreign support for its war-battered economy now more than ever before. \"We expect a common effort between the central bank and Arab central banks and monetary authorities to create an Arab fund to support and preserve the value of the currency when needed,\" he said. Twelve years of civil war have devastated productive sectors of the Lebanese economy and created gaping trade and budget deficits. Bouldikian said recent government measures had succeeded in reducing demand for imports and increasing exports. \"These are encouraging factors, but the war has not ended yet,\" he said. \"We believe that with a just political solution acceptable to all sides, confidence will return and this will benefit the Lebanese pound and Lebanon.\" In the meantime, he said the central bank had four main goals: 1) to use surplus liquidity to finance the budget deficit 2) to increase the role of commercial banks and non-bank financing institutions in financing the deficit 3) to limit the transfer of Lebanese pounds into foreign currency deposits 4) to protect the financial health of commercial banks. CHINA POSTPONES PLAN TO SCRAP PARALLEL CURRENCY Chinese Vice-Premier Tian Jiyun said plans to scrap the country\\'s parallel currency, Foreign Exchange Certificates (FECs), had been postponed due to objections from foreign businessmen and others. But Tian told a news conference the Chinese government still considered FECs unsatisfactory. Asked about the current state of plans to abolish the FECs, Tian said: \"We have decided to postpone the question. As to whether it will be done in the future, it will be done according to the evolution of the situation.\" He said many people, including foreign businessmen, had raised objections to the plan to abolish the certificates, and added: \"It is rather complicated.\" The FECs were introduced in 1980 for use by foreigners in China. But they now circulate widely among local residents and there is a big black market in the currency, though it is theoretically at par with the ordinary Chinese currency, renminbi. Tian said the government still considered that the FECs had \"many demerits and negative influences.\" Bank of China President Wang Deyan told Reuters earlier this month that he thought it unlikely that the certificates would be scrapped this year. Western diplomats and economists have said the Chinese authorities are having trouble finding a suitable alternative. Vice-Premier Yao Yilin announced at a similar press conference last year that the FECs would be abolished, saying the government had decided it was ideologically unacceptable to have two currencies circulating in China at the same time. ARAB BANKER SAYS TOO SOON FOR SINGLE CURRENCY Gulf Arab states must coordinate economic policies more closely before moving towards their goal of a unified currency system, the President of the Arab Bankers Association said. Hikmat Nashashibi told a news conference at the end of an Arab currency traders meeting: \"We have to start with coordination of fiscal policies as a prerequisite for a common system of currencies ... There is quite a substantial way to go yet.\" He said only then would a unified Gulf currency system be a plausible project. The six nations of the Gulf Cooperation Council -- Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates --  have held a series of meetings this year to examine linking their currencies to a single peg in a system which bankers say could be modelled on the European Monetary System (EMS). At present, five currencies are linked either officially or in practice to the U.S. Dollar, while the Kuwaiti dinar is pegged to a trade-weighted basket of currencies. A common currency system or EMS-style \"grid\" would, in theory, foster regional trade by providing a basis for stable exchange rates, but Nashashibi said inter-Arab trade is at a very low ebb and capital flows between Gulf states remain small. \"Capital markets in the Arab world are still in their infancy,\" he said. Nashashibi said lack of experience among Arab banks, a paucity of financial instruments and a legal framework that often does not recognise the western banking concept of interest have hampered the growth of Arab markets. ITALY RELAXES RESTRICTIONS ON LIRA IMPORTS Italy is to modify restrictions limiting the amount of lira cash that can be brought in and out of the country, the Foreign Trade Ministry said. A statement said Foreign Trade Minister Rino Formica has signed a measure lifting currency regulations that currently impose a 400,000 lire limit on the value of lira bank notes that can be brought into Italy. It did not say when the new measure would come into force. In future, there will be no limit to the amount of lira bank notes both residents and non-residents can bring into Italy. The statement said the 400,000 lire limit would remain for Italian residents wishing to take cash out of the country, but non-residents could re-export lira cash if they made appropriate declarations at customs points. It said the lifting of the restrictions \"reinforces the international status of the lira and meets the requirements expressed several times by foreign exchange dealers.\" ARAB FOREX ASSOCIATION ELECTS NEW CHAIRMAN The Inter-Arab Cambist Association (ICA) elected Abdullah al-Dakhil of Kuwait\\'s Burgan Bank its new chairman, succeeding Hani Ramadan of Beirut Riyad Bank for a three-year term, ICA officials said The annual meeting elected three Vice-Chairmen -- Ezzedine Saidane of Banque Internationale Arabe de Tunis, Mohammed Osman of Societe Bancaire du Liban and Walid Nasouli of Morgan Guaranty Trust Co of New York. Ibrahim Buhindi of the Saudi National Commercial Bank in Bahrain and Imad Bata of Finance and Credit Corp of Jordan were elected Secretary and Treasurer, respectively. DOLLAR OPENS AT A RECORD LOW FOR TOKYO AT 145.80 YEN - DEALERS DOLLAR OPENS AT A RECORD LOW FOR TOKYO AT 145.80 YEN - DEALERS Bank of Japan intervenes, buys dollars around 145.90-95 yen -- Tokyo dealers Bank of Japan intervenes, buys dollars around 145.90-95 yen -- Tokyo dealers DOLLAR FALLS BELOW 145.00 YEN IN TOKYO -- DEALERS DOLLAR FALLS BELOW 145.00 YEN IN TOKYO -- DEALERS BANK OF JAPAN ALREADY PURCHASED ONE BILLION DLRS IN MORNING INTERVENTION - DEALERS BANK OF JAPAN ALREADY PURCHASED ONE BILLION DLRS IN MORNING INTERVENTION - DEALERS JAPAN CENTRAL BANK BUYS ONE BILLION DLRS IN TOKYO The Bank of Japan has already purchased more than one billion dlrs in intervention since the opening and continues to buy the U.S. Currency, dealers said. The central bank was supporting the dollar against the yen amid heavy selling pressure from investment trusts and securities houses which had pushed the dollar as low as 144.75 yen earlier this morning, they said. The dollar recovered slightly from the intervention and was trading around 145.00, they added. It had opened in Tokyo at 145.80 yen. Sumita says he does not repeat not expect dollar to fall further. Sumita says he does not repeat not expect dollar to fall further. Japan will continue to cooperate with other nations to stabilize dlr, Sumita Japan will continue to cooperate with other nations to stabilize dlr, Sumita SUMITA SAYS HE DOES NOT EXPECT FURTHER DOLLAR FALL Bank of Japan governor Satoshi Sumita said he does not expect the dollar to remain unstable and fall further. He told a Lower House Budget Committee in Parliament that the Bank of Japan would continue to cooperate closely with other major nations to stabilize exchange rates. The central bank has been keeping extremely careful watch on exchange rate movements since last week, he said. He said the dollar would not continue to fall because of underlying market concern about the rapid rise of the yen. Sumita said the currency market has been reacting to overseas statements and to trade tension between Japan and the U.S. Over semiconductors. The yen\\'s tendency to rise will prevent Japan from expanding domestic demand and undertaking necessary economic restructuring, he said. DLR FALLS ON FEAR TOKYO WON\\'T HIKE DEMAND-MIYAZAWA Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said that the dollar\\'s drop today to 145 yen is partly attributable to the perception inside and outside Japan that the country has failed to fulfill its promise to expand domestic demand. He told a Lower House budget committee in Parliament that it was natural for other nations to think that Japan is not doing enough because of the delay in the passage of the 1987/88 budget. The budget has been delayed by opposition boycotts of Parliament to protest government plans for a new sales tax. JAPAN CAREFULLY CONSIDERING MONEY POLICY -- SUMITA Bank of Japan governor Satoshi Sumita said the central bank will carefully consider its monetary policy in light of the recent sharp fall of the dollar. Asked if the Bank of Japan will consider a further cut in its discount rate, he said he now thinks the bank will have to carefully consider its future money policy. He told a Lower House Budget Committee in Parliament that credit conditions have been eased by the five discount rate cuts by Japan since the beginning of last year. Japan must now be especially careful about a flare-up in inflation, with money supply growth accelerating, he said. Sumita said the central bank would continue to make a judgement on monetary policies while watching consumer prices, exchange rates and economic and financial conditions both in and outside Japan. Asked if the September 1985 Plaza agreement was a failure because the dollar had fallen too far, Sumita said he still thought the pact was a good one in the sense that it had corrected the overvaluation of the dollar. But the Plaza accord did not set any target for the dollar\\'s fall, he said. The dollar\\'s steep fall stems from the market\\'s belief that the trade imbalance will continue to expand, he said. Nakasone says major nations committed in Paris to stable dlr above 150 yen Nakasone says major nations committed in Paris to stable dlr above 150 yen Miyazawa says major nations have intervened aggressively since dlr fell below 150 yen Miyazawa says major nations have intervened aggressively since dlr fell below 150 yen G-6 WANTS TO HOLD DLR ABOVE 150 YEN - NAKASONE Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone said that Japan and other industrialized nations committed themselves in Paris last month to stabilize the dollar above 150 yen. He told a Lower House Budget Committee in Parliament that the six nations have taken measures, including market intervention, to support the dollar above that level. Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told the same committee that the six - Britain, Canada, France, Japan, the U.S. And West Germany - had intervened aggressively since the dollar fell below 150 yen. Miyazawa said major nations are trying hard to stabilize exchange rates. Asked if there had been any change in the fundamentals of each nation since the February 22 Paris accord, he said he did not think the fundamentals themselves had changed substantially. But he said the market is sensitively looking at what is happening in major nations. He did not elaborate. Miyazawa added that it was difficult to say why there has been such speculative dollar selling in the market. JAPAN ISOLATED, YEN RISES, WORLD FEELS CHEATED Japan is becoming dangerously isolated again as the U.S. And Europe feel they have been cheated by Japanese promises to switch from export to domestic-led growth, officials and businessmen from around the world said. As the dollar today slipped to a record low below 145 yen, making Japanese exporters and holders of dollar investments grit their teeth harder, Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said there was a perception Japan had reneged on its promise. The problem goes deep and centres on misunderstandings by both sides over the key Maekawa report of April, last year. The document was prepared by a private committee formed by Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone and led by former Bank of Japan head Haruo Maekawa. It recommended that to stop friction due to its large trade surpluses, Japan must \"make a historical transformation in its traditional policies on economic management and the nation\\'s lifestyle. There can be no further development for Japan without this transformation.\" Americans and Europeans took the report to heart and have looked in vain for clear signs of this historic change. But the Japanese remain doubtful about the short, or even medium term prospects of totally transforming their economic habits. The bubble of frustration against what appears as Japanese prevarication burst last week. The U.S. Said it intended to raise tariffs of as much as 300 mln dlrs on Japanese exports to the U.S. On the grounds Japan had abrogated a bilateral semiconductor pact. British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher threatened to block Japanese financial firms from London after the Japanese placed what the British say are restrictive conditions on a bid by British firm Cable and Wireless to join a domestic telecommunications joint venture. On Friday, European currency dealers said European central banks, annoyed at restrictive Japanese trade practises, might leave Japan alone to intervene to staunch the rise of the yen. Eishiro Saito, head of top Japanese business group Keidanren, spotted the dangers inherent in such contradictory views last November when he visited the European Community. \"Related to this matter of (trade) imbalance, the point that I found to be of great cause for alarm during this trip to Europe was the excessive degree of hope placed by the Europeans in the results of the Maekawa report,\" he said. \"We explained that the process of restructuring the economy away from its dependence on exports toward a balance between domestic and external demand...Would take time,\" Saito said. Saito\\'s words were ignored. In February, EC Industrial Policy Director Heinrich von Moltke came to Japan and said \"I only know that your government, under the leadership of Maekawa, points to restructuring your economy into a less outward looking, more inward looking one. It is the Maekawa report which has attracted the most attention in Europe.\" And Europeans and Americans want quick action. \"A far better answer than protectionism would be structural change within the Japanese economy, the kind suggested by the Maekawa report. And we hope to see changes occur in the near future,\" visiting Chairman of General Motors Roger Smith said in March. Such expectations are now ingrained, which was partly the fault of Nakasone, who heralded Maekawa\\'s report as a sea of change in Japanese affairs, said U.S. Officials. Months before the report was issued, U.S. And EC business leaders met their Japanese colleagues to discuss the trade problem. \"We are more anxious than ever that the new approach of the Maekawa committee does lead to speedy and effective action,\" said EC Industrial Union leader Lord Ray Pennock. \"The important implication of the Maekawa report is that it is finally looking to let Japanese enjoy the fruits of their labour,\" said Philip Caldwell, Senior Managing Director of Shearson Lehman Brothers. Contents of the report were leaded well ahead of issuance. Japanese officials say they are implementing the report as fast as they can, said a European ambassador who has travelled the country asking about this issue. He said People mentioned many things in line with the spirit of the report, including restructuring of the coal and steel industries. A major misunderstanding is that the private report was government policy. Europeans are confused about this, underlined by von Moltke\\'s reference to the \"leadership\" of the Maekawa report. Even so, Japanese officials point to last September\\'s government programme of new economic measures. \"Without endorsing the report as policy, officials point out that the government has put its signature to a programme designed to implement the report,\" the ambassador said. H.K. DEALERS SAY NAKASONE G-6 COMMENT TOO LATE Remarks by Japan\\'s Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone that last month\\'s G-6 meeting agreed to stabilize the dollar above 150 yen have come too late to influence currency trading, dealers said. After Nakasone\\'s statement the dollar rose to 146.40/50 yen from an initial low of 144.20/40 and New York\\'s Friday finish of 147.15/25. But the rebound was largely on short-covering, they said. \"I think (Nakasone\\'s) desperate,\" said a U.S. Bank foreign exchange manager. Nakasone told a Lower House Budget Committee in Parliament that Japan and other industrialized nations committed themselves in Paris last month to stabilize the dollar above 150 yen. Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told the same committee that the six - Britain, Canada, France, Japan, the U.S. And West Germany - had intervened aggressively since the dollar fell below 150 yen. \"His (Nakasone) remarks should have been made and should have had a bigger influence when the dollar was still above 150 yen,\" said P.S. Tam of Morgan Guaranty Trust. Tam said the dollar has hit short-term chart targets  and is likely to rebound. But he warned of another dip to below 145 yen. Dealers said the worsening trade relations between the U.S. And Japan will continue to depress the dollar. The trade issue has now become a political issue since the Reagan Administration is facing uproar in Congress over th3pYgks in cutting the country\\'s 169.8 billion dlr trade deficit, they said. BAHRAIN INTRODUCES NEW MONEY MARKET REGIME Bahrain is introducing a new domestic money market regime to provide dinar liquidity aid centred on the island\\'s newly launched treasury bill programme. The Bahrain Monetary Agency has issued a circular to all commercial banks outlining a new policy from April 1 which gives liquidity aid through sale and repurchase agreements in treasury bills, or through discounting them. The circular, released officially to Reuters, said current arrangements for providing liquidity aid will no longer be valid except \"in quite exceptional circumstances.\" Under the current system, the agency provides the island\\'s 20 commercial banks with dinar liquidity by means of short-term swaps against U.S. Dollars and, less frequently, by short-term loans secured against government development bonds. \"The agency considers that it is now appropriate to replace these operations with short-term assistance based on Government of Bahrain treasury bills,\" the circular to banks states. The agency said it will repurchase treasury bills with a simultaneous agreement to resell them to the same bank at a higher price which will reflect an interest charge. The agency said it envisages the repurchase agreements will normally be for a period of seven days. Bahrain launched a weekly tender for two mln dinars of 91-day treasury bills in mid-December last year and has since raised a total of 26 mln dinars through the programme. Bahrain\\'s commercial banks are currently liquid and have been making little use of the traditional dollar swaps offered by the agency. But banking sources said the new regime from April 1 will mean banks cannot afford not to hold treasury bills in case they need funds from the central bank. Banking sources said more than half of the 20 banks hold treasury bills, although the need by others to take up paper could increase demand at weekly tenders and push down allotted yields slightly. Last week\\'s yield was six pct, although the programme had started at the end of last year with rates as low as 5.60 pct. Banking sources said the cost of liquidity through repurchase accords will not differ much from that on dollar swaps. But a bank using dollars to obtain liquidity would foresake interest on the U.S. Currency while the underlying treasury bill investment is unaffected in a repurchase accord. BANK OF ENGLAND FORECASTS SURPLUS IN MONEY MARKET The Bank of England said it forecast a liquidity surplus of around 100 mln stg in the money market today. Among the main factors affecting liquidity, exchequer transactions will add some 985 mln stg to the system today while a fall in note circulation and bankers\\' balances above target will add around 360 mln stg and 110 mln stg respectively. Partly offsetting these inflows, bills for repurchase by the market will drain some 785 mln stg while bills maturing in official hands and the treasury bill take-up will remove about 546 mln stg. INDONESIAN RUPIAH SLIPS AGAINST MARK AND YEN The Indonesian rupiah has held steady since its 31 pct devaluation against the dollar six months ago, but has slipped against the mark and to a lesser extent against the yen, according to central bank figures. In the past month, the rupiah has fallen five pct against the yen. Today\\'s middle rate per 100 yen was 1,129.78 against 1,075.20 at end-February and 1,058.6 at devaluation in September. Bank Indonesia\\'s quoted rate for the dollar, the main currency for Indonesia\\'s oil and gas exports, was 1,644.0 today, the same rate fixed at the time of devaluation. The rate for the West German mark was 913.28 today, a sharp drop from September when it was 786.06. The British pound has risen to 2,657.93 against 2,429.83. The value of the rupiah is set daily against a basket of currencies by the central bank. The rise in the value of the mark and the yen has hit Indonesia by increasing its debt servicing levels. Its total disbursed foreign debt is estimated by the World Bank at 37 billion dlrs. Japan is one of Indonesia\\'s key trading partners, taking half its oil exports. Miyazawa expects dollar to rebound soon, spokesman says Miyazawa expects dollar to rebound soon, spokesman says PHILADELPHIA EXCHANGE TO EXTEND HOURS FOR ASIA The Philadelphia Stock Exchange (PHLX), a leading trader of currency options, plans to extend its trading hours to serve Australasian and Far Eastern markets, exchange president Nicholas Giordano said. He told reporters the PHLX will open a new session between 1900 and 2300 hours U.S. EST from the beginning of the third quarter this year. The PHLX is also opening an office in Hong Kong to serve clients in the region and educate financial markets about the advantages of currency options, Giordano said. Giordano was in Sydney to start an Asian-Pacific tour by exchange executives promoting the hedging benefits of the exchange-trade currency option market against existing over-the-counter option trading during the local working day. Currency options pioneered by the PHLX in 1982 had become an accepted means of hedging against foreign exchange risk and had grown in popularity, he said. The PHLX now offered options in eight currencies, including a new Australian dollar option, and traded an average 42,000 contracts daily with underlying open interest of more than 30 billion U.S. Dlrs. Giordano said the exchange had been impressed with the performance of its Australian dollar contract, which since its introduction last year had regularly topped the French franc as the third most popular traded option, with up to 8,000 contracts traded daily. Having the Philadelphia exchange open during the Asia-Pacific market day would open new hedging opportunities, set a truer level for over-the-counter option trading, increase arbitraging opportunities and give corporations and treasuries access to a currency option market of much greater depth and liquidity with the security of a clearing house, he said. MIYAZAWA EXPECTS DOLLAR REBOUND SOON - SPOKESMAN Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa expects the dollar to rebound soon, a Ministry spokesman said. He quoted Miyazawa as telling Japanese reporters that major industrial nations are aggressively intervening in currency markets worldwide to prevent a dollar free-fall. The minister believes that market forces will push the dollar back up from its record low of 144.70 yen today, according to the spokesman. Miyazawa told the Japanese reporters the U.S. Unit fell because Japanese investors sold dollars to hedge currency risks before the close of the 1986/87 fiscal year on March 31. JAPAN CONDUCTS CURRENCY SURVEY OF BIG INVESTORS A Finance Ministry official said the ministry has recently conducted a survey on foreign exchange transactions by institutional investors but declined to say if it was aimed at moderating their dollar sales. However, financial market sources said they had heard the ministry has asked life insurance and securities firms to refrain from selling dollars, but they were unable to confirm this directly. Dealers said life insurance firms were not major sellers of dollars in recent trading sessions because they had already sold them to hedge risks. Dealers said securities houses and trust banks on the other hand have aggressively sold the dollar. NO INTERVENTION, DOLLAR FIXED AT 1.8063 MARKS The Bundesbank did not intervene as the dollar was fixed lower at 1.8063 marks after 1.8231 on Friday, dealers said. Business calmed down after a hectic start, with European operators sidelined because of uncertainty about the short-term direction of the dollar, dealers said. \"At the moment, all the action is taking place in New York and Tokyo,\" one said. The U.S. Currency traded within a 145 basis point range in Europe, touching a low of 1.7940 and a high of 1.8085 marks. But it remained within a narrow 40 basis point span around 1.8050 marks after the first hour of European trading. Comments by Japanese officials and Bank of Japan dollar support had pushed it above 145 yen and 1.80 marks after falling as low as 144.50 and 1.7860 respectively in Tokyo. BANK OF ENGLAND DOES NOT OPERATE IN MONEY MARKET The Bank of England said it had not operated in the money market during the morning session. Earlier, the Bank revised its forecast of the liquidity position to flat from its original estimate of a 100 mln stg surplus. ASIAN DOLLAR MARKET ASSETS FALL IN JANUARY The gross size of the Asian dollar market contracted to 197.2 billion U.S. Dlrs in January, down 3.4 billion dlrs from December, reflecting a decline in interbank activity, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said in its latest monthly bulletin. The assets stood at 151.7 billion dlrs in January last year. MAS said interbank lending fell in January to 140.9 billion dlrs from 146.6 billion in December but rose from 102.0 billion in january 1986 and interbank deposits to 154.0 billion against 159.4 and 117.1 billion, respectively. Loans to non-bank customers increased to 40.1 billion dlrs in January from 38.7 billion in December and 36.9 billion in January, 1986. Deposits of non-bank customers also increased in January to 34.9 billion from 33.8 billion a month ago and 27.7 billion a year ago.

The document was prepared by a private committee formed by Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone and led by former Bank of Japan head Haruo Maekawa. It recommended that to stop friction due to its large trade surpluses, Japan must \"make a historical transformation in its traditional policies on economic management and the nation\\'s lifestyle. There can be no further development for Japan without this transformation.\" Americans and Europeans took the report to heart and have looked in vain for clear signs of this historic change. But the Japanese remain doubtful about the short, or even medium term prospects of totally transforming their economic habits. The bubble of frustration against what appears as Japanese prevarication burst last week. The U.S. Said it intended to raise tariffs of as much as 300 mln dlrs on Japanese exports to the U.S. On the grounds Japan had abrogated a bilateral semiconductor pact. British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher threatened to block Japanese financial firms from London after the Japanese placed what the British say are restrictive conditions on a bid by British firm Cable and Wireless to join a domestic telecommunications joint venture. On Friday, European currency dealers said European central banks, annoyed at restrictive Japanese trade practises, might leave Japan alone to intervene to staunch the rise of the yen. Eishiro Saito, head of top Japanese business group Keidanren, spotted the dangers inherent in such contradictory views last November when he visited the European Community. \"Related to this matter of (trade) imbalance, the point that I found to be of great cause for alarm during this trip to Europe was the excessive degree of hope placed by the Europeans in the results of the Maekawa report,\" he said. \"We explained that the process of restructuring the economy away from its dependence on exports toward a balance between domestic and external demand...Would take time,\" Saito said. Saito\\'s words were ignored. In February, EC Industrial Policy Director Heinrich von Moltke came to Japan and said \"I only know that your government, under the leadership of Maekawa, points to restructuring your economy into a less outward looking, more inward looking one. It is the Maekawa report which has attracted the most attention in Europe.\" And Europeans and Americans want quick action. \"A far better answer than protectionism would be structural change within the Japanese economy, the kind suggested by the Maekawa report. And we hope to see changes occur in the near future,\" visiting Chairman of General Motors Roger Smith said in March. Such expectations are now ingrained, which was partly the fault of Nakasone, who heralded Maekawa\\'s report as a sea of change in Japanese affairs, said U.S. Officials. Months before the report was issued, U.S. And EC business leaders met their Japanese colleagues to discuss the trade problem. \"We are more anxious than ever that the new approach of the Maekawa committee does lead to speedy and effective action,\" said EC Industrial Union leader Lord Ray Pennock. \"The important implication of the Maekawa report is that it is finally looking to let Japanese enjoy the fruits of their labour,\" said Philip Caldwell, Senior Managing Director of Shearson Lehman Brothers. Contents of the report were leaded well ahead of issuance. Japanese officials say they are implementing the report as fast as they can, said a European ambassador who has travelled the country asking about this issue. He said People mentioned many things in line with the spirit of the report, including restructuring of the coal and steel industries. A major misunderstanding is that the private report was government policy. Europeans are confused about this, underlined by von Moltke\\'s reference to the \"leadership\" of the Maekawa report. Even so, Japanese officials point to last September\\'s government programme of new economic measures. \"Without endorsing the report as policy, officials point out that the government has put its signature to a programme designed to implement the report,\" the ambassador said. PHILADELPHIA EXCHANGE TO EXTEND HOURS FOR ASIA The Philadelphia Stock Exchange (PHLX), a leading trader of currency options, plans to extend its trading hours to serve Australasian and Far Eastern markets, exchange president Nicholas Giordano said. He told reporters the PHLX will open a new session between 1900 and 2300 hours U.S. EST from the beginning of the third quarter this year. The PHLX is also opening an office in Hong Kong to serve clients in the region and educate financial markets about the advantages of currency options, Giordano said. Giordano was in Sydney to start an Asian-Pacific tour by exchange executives promoting the hedging benefits of the exchange-trade currency option market against existing over-the-counter option trading during the local working day. Currency options pioneered by the PHLX in 1982 had become an accepted means of hedging against foreign exchange risk and had grown in popularity, he said. The PHLX now offered options in eight currencies, including a new Australian dollar option, and traded an average 42,000 contracts daily with underlying open interest of more than 30 billion U.S. Dlrs. Giordano said the exchange had been impressed with the performance of its Australian dollar contract, which since its introduction last year had regularly topped the French franc as the third most popular traded option, with up to 8,000 contracts traded daily. Having the Philadelphia exchange open during the Asia-Pacific market day would open new hedging opportunities, set a truer level for over-the-counter option trading, increase arbitraging opportunities and give corporations and treasuries access to a currency option market of much greater depth and liquidity with the security of a clearing house, he said. JAPAN CAREFULLY CONSIDERING MONEY POLICY - SUMITA Bank of Japan governor Satoshi Sumita said the central bank will carefully consider its monetary policy in light of the recent sharp fall of the dollar. Asked if the Bank of Japan will consider a further cut in its discount rate, he said he now thinks the bank will have to carefully consider its future money policy. He told a Lower House Budget Committee in Parliament that credit conditions have been eased by the five discount rate cuts by Japan since the beginning of last year. Japan must now be especially careful about a flare-up in inflation, with money supply growth accelerating, he said. Sumita said the central bank would continue to make a judgement on monetary policies while watching consumer prices, exchange rates and economic and financial conditions both in and outside Japan. Asked if the September 1985 Plaza agreement was a failure because the dollar had fallen too far, Sumita said he still thought the pact was a good one in the sense that it had corrected the overvaluation of the dollar. But the Plaza accord did not set any target for the dollar\\'s fall, he said. The dollar\\'s steep fall stems from the market\\'s belief that the trade imbalance will continue to expand, he said. U.S. APPEARS TO TOLERATE FURTHER DLR DECLINE In a bid to hasten Japan\\'s promise to speed up its economic growth and open markets to foreign trade, top U.S. officials appear once again to have signaled their tolerance of a lower dollar. Treasury Secretary James Baker and one of his top aides, Assistant Secretary David Mulford, said last week there was no target for the dollar, a statement that sent the yen soaring against the dollar, despite massive central bank intervention. \"That was no slip of the tongue,\" said one western monetary official, who asked not to be identified. For now, the strategy appears to be working. Japanese officials said late last week a package to bolster domestic demand will be ready in early April. Until last week, there were few indications the package would be ready anytime soon. The Reagan administration, facing an uproar in Congress over the apparent lack of progress in cutting the 169.8 billion dlr trade deficit, is learning now that to extract results from Japan, dramatic action is required. Last week the White House imposed unprecedented tariffs on certain Japanese electronic goods after Tokyo failed to adhere to a semi-conductor pricing accord between the two countries. The shift in U.S. strategy, in part designed to appease mounting Congressional anger over Japanese policies, comes just two weeks before industrial nations reconvene here to review the Paris agreement to stabilize currencies. And news that Japan earned a record 18 billion dlr trade surplus in the first two months this year just underscored the need for urgent action, in the view of U.S. officials. Nonetheless, U.S. officials see signs of improvement in the deficit. \"I\\'d be stunned if we were not going to derive some benefits (from the lower dollar) soon,\" said one. In Paris, leading industrial nations agreed to cooperate closely to foster currency stability within ranges reflecting \"underlying economic fundamentals\" or economic reality. The agreement envisages those fundamentals to include Japan and West Germany stimulating their economies and the United States cutting its budget deficit. The three nations, joined by France, Britain and Canada, agree these policies are essential to redress huge global trade imbalances. But analysts say markets have signalled the underlying fundamentals imply a lower dollar, rather than a stable one. Markets, in effect, are less confident than governments that these measures -- including U.S. budget deficit cuts agreed by Congress and the White House --will be carried out. Nonetheless, the dollar\\'s sharp fall has not undermined cooperation. A U.S. economic policymaker said the accord was on track and Tokyo and Bonn seem \"to want more stimulative measures which is what the Paris accord calls for.\" International monetary sources said exchange market developments generally have not unsettled policymakers, although Japan is an obvious exception. \"Everybody feels it can still be managed,\" one source said of market developments. But last week, the Bank of Japan spent an estimated five billion dlrs intervening to halt the rise in the yen, and other central banks about one billion dlrs. Another monetary source said Japan was upset with America\\'s half-hearted attempt to halt the falling dollar, flouting the Paris accord outright. The source, close to the top levels of Japanese economic policymaking, said Japan\\'s understanding of the accord was that the yen would be kept at around 154 to the dollar, the level it stood at when the accord was struck. The source said Tokyo was extremely worried by Washington\\'s use of the exchange rate to change Japanese policies. It was a \"pointed reminder\" to Japan to do something about the trade issues, the source said of the dollar\\'s fall against the yen. By departing last Sunday from the language of the Paris accord -- that nations agreed to foster currency stability around current levels -- Baker triggered a run on the dollar. Later in the week, Mulford too said there was no target for the dollar and called on Japan and West Germany to live up to their international responsibilities and stimulate growth. But U.S. officials said recent market developments will not unravel the spirit of the Paris agreement. \"There\\'s a realisation now that you cannot leave things alone, everyone agrees that the external (trade) imbalances ought to be adjusted,\" one official said. \"While no-one is going to cede national sovereignty, we certainly seem to be moving towards much closer co-operation,\" another U.S. official said. The officials said the meeting here, where the six will be joined by Italy, will be a status report. \"Japan will have to explain what the state of their program is and Germany will report on its plans. Maybe there\\'s a need to move faster,\" one source said. Mulford told Congress last week the Paris accord called, in effect, for currency stability for several months. This would buy time for Japan and West Germany to speed up their economic growth and help bring down the U.S. trade deficit. His comments appeared to serve notice on other major nations that Washington cannot wait too long for action to reduce the gap between the Japanese and German trade surpluses and the U.S. trade deficit. U.S. BANKER PREDICTS FURTHER DOLLAR FALL THIS YEAR A leading U.S. Banker said the dollar was likely to fall another five to 10 pct this year and an improvement in the huge American trade deficit would be only temporary at current world exchange rate levels. Kurt Viermetz, worldwide treasurer of Morgan Guaranty Trust Co, told Arab currency traders meeting here that the steady depreciation of the dollar had not gone far enough to rein in U.S. deficits on a lasting basis. U.K. MONEY MARKET GIVEN 129 MLN STG ASSISTANCE The Bank of England said it had provided the money market with assistance worth 129 mln stg in the afternoon session. This compares with the Bank\\'s forecast of a shortage in the system today of around 100 mln stg. The central bank purchased 129 mln stg bank bills in band one at 9-7/8 pct. JAPAN SET TO RIDE OUT YEN RISE, OFFICIALS SAY The government is determined to ride out the latest sharp rise of the yen without taking panic measures because it expects the currency\\'s appreciation to prove temporary, senior officials said. \"The market has already located a ceiling (for the yen) and market forces are pushing the dollar back up a bit,\" one senior Finance Ministry official said. He attributed the dollar\\'s fall in recent days to special factors, in particular, selling by Japanese investors ahead of the March 31 end to their fiscal year. That selling largely came to an end this morning after about one hour of trading here, the senior official said. \"They (the investors) became more or less quiet after 10 o\\'clock (0100 GMT),\" he said. After falling to a record low of 144.70 yen this morning, the dollar edged back up in late trading to end at 146.20. Dealers attributed the late rise to remarks by Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone that major nations had agreed to stabilise the dollar above 150 yen. Several officials said they did not see any fundamental reason for the dollar\\'s recent sharp fall. One official even called the market\\'s recent actions irrational. If anything, the U.S. Decision to slap tariffs on Japanese electronics goods should support the dollar against the yen because it will cut Japanese exports to the U.S., He said. As a result, several officials said they saw no reason to alter the broad thrust of government policy agreed to at last month\\'s meeting of major nations in Paris. \"We don\\'t see any substantial reason to change our policy stance,\" one senior official said. H.K. DEALERS SAY NAKASONE G-6 COMMENT TOO LATE Remarks by Japan\\'s Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone that last month\\'s G-6 meeting agreed to stabilize the dollar above 150 yen have come too late to influence currency trading, dealers said. After Nakasone\\'s statement the dollar rose to 146.40/50 yen from an initial low of 144.20/40 and New York\\'s Friday finish of 147.15/25. But the rebound was largely on short-covering, they said. \"I think (Nakasone\\'s) desperate,\" said a U.S. Bank foreign exchange manager. Nakasone told a Lower House Budget Committee in Parliament that Japan and other industrialized nations committed themselves in Paris last month to stabilize the dollar above 150 yen. Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told the same committee that the six - Britain, Canada, France, Japan, the U.S. And West Germany - had intervened aggressively since the dollar fell below 150 yen. \"His (Nakasone) remarks should have been made and should have had a bigger influence when the dollar was still above 150 yen,\" said P.S. Tam of Morgan Guaranty Trust. Tam said the dollar has hit short-term chart targets  and is likely to rebound. But he warned of another dip to below 145 yen. Dealers said the worsening trade relations between the U.S. And Japan will continue to depress the dollar. The trade issue has now become a political issue since the Reagan Administration is facing uproar in Congress over th3pYgks in cutting the country\\'s 169.8 billion dlr trade deficit, they said. JAPAN CONDUCTS CURRENCY SURVEY OF BIG INVESTORS A Finance Ministry official said the ministry has recently conducted a survey on foreign exchange transactions by institutional investors but declined to say if it was aimed at moderating their dollar sales. However, financial market sources said they had heard the ministry has asked life insurance and securities firms to refrain from selling dollars, but they were unable to confirm this directly. Dealers said life insurance firms were not major sellers of dollars in recent trading sessions because they had already sold them to hedge risks. Dealers said securities houses and trust banks on the other hand have aggressively sold the dollar. JAPANESE SEEN LIGHTENING U.S. BOND HOLDINGS The dollar\\'s tumble to a record low of 144.70 yen in Tokyo today motivated some major Japanese investors to lighten their U.S. Bond inventory further and is expected to spur diversification into investment assets including foreign and domestic shares, dealers said. The key U.S. 7-1/2 pct Treasury bond due 2016 fell to a low of 96.08-12 in early Tokyo trade against the 98.05-06 New York finish, then recovered to 96.20-22. Some trust bank pension fund acccounts and investment trusts were seen selling several hundred million dollars on the foreign exchange market here today, accentuating the unit\\'s tumble, securities house dealers said. They seem undecided on what to do with the fresh yen cash positions resulting from their dollar sales today, and are sidelined until the currency market stabilises and the interest rates outlook clarifies, a Nikko Securities Co Ltd currency trader said. The dollar\\'s plunge and low yields on U.S. Bonds will further promote diversification into other foreign investments, as well as call back funds into the domestic bond and stock markets from overseas bond markets, securities bond managers said. They said major Japanese investors in the past two years are estimated to have held 50 to 80 pct of their foreign portfolios in U.S. Bonds but many have lightened their U.S. Bond inventory to as low as 40 pct. Since late last year, Japanese investors, seeking substantial liquidity and attractive yields, have used fresh funds to buy mark and Canadian dollar bonds and, after the Paris currency pact, actively bought French franc bonds and gilts while gradually lightening U.S. Bond inventories, the managers said. Dealers said funds tied up in foreign assets had flowed into local bond and stock markets as well. The yield of the key 5.1 pct 89th bond dropped to a record low of 4.080 pct today from the 4.140 Saturday finish and compared with 4.25 pct on three-month certificates of deposit. The key bond has fluctuated less than five basis points for more than a month here, suggesting most dealers could not satisfy their needs for capital gains, dealers said. A market survey by Reuters showed some active accounts in U.S. Treasuries are currently dealing on Tokyo\\'s stock market. The stock market\\'s bullishness late last week was partly due to funds transferred from U.S. Treasuries, dealers said. Japanese net purchases of foreign securities in the first half of March fell an estimated one billion dlrs compared with average monthly net purchases of 7.7 billion for the whole of 1986, Finance Ministry sources said. The steep fall is due to Japanese investors\\' cool attitude towards U.S. Bonds, which had amounted to more than 80 pct of total foreign securities purchased, securities houses managers said. Foreign stock buying in March is expected to exceed the record high of 1.5 billion dlrs seen in December, they said. \"Diversification of foreign portfolios is underway and we have bought bonds in currencies such as marks, the Canadian dollar, the ECU and French franc,\" a fund manager at &lt;Yasuda Trust and Banking Co Ltd> said. FED SETS TWO BILLION DLR CUSTOMER REPURCHASE, FED SAYS FED SETS TWO BILLION DLR CUSTOMER REPURCHASE, FED SAYS FED ADDS RESERVES VIA CUSTOMER REPURCHASES The Federal Reserve entered the U.S. Government securities market to arrange two billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreements, a Fed spokesman said. Dealers said Federal funds were trading at 6-3/8 pct when the Fed began its temporary and indirect supply of reserves to the banking system. FORMER TREASURY OFFICIAL URGES CURRENCY REFORMS Former Treasury official C. Fred Bergsten said a new exchange rate system is needed to replace the fixed and flexible exchange rate systems which he said had not worked. \"I prefer a move to \\'target zones\\' in which the major countries would determine ranges of 15-20 pct within which they would pledge to hold their exchange rates by direct intervention and, as necessary, by changes in monetary and other policies,\" Bergsten, now the director of the Institute for International Economics, said in a statement to a House Banking subcommittee. \"The substantial correction of the exchange rate that has occurred since early 1985 is enormously welcome, and should produce a sizeable reduction in the U.S. trade deficit this year and next, but the imbalance will not fall much below 100 billion dlrs on present policies, so much more is needed,\" he said. FED WILL BUY BILLS FOR CUSTOMER AFTER AUCTION The Federal Reserve said it will enter the U.S. Government securities market after the 1300 EST weekly bill auction to purchase around 900 mln dlrs of Treasury bills for customers, a spokesman said. He said the Fed will purchase bills with maturities from May through September 10. Dealers said Federal funds were trading at 6-3/8 pct when the Fed announced the operation. PARIS MEET AGREED NOT TO PUBLISH BANDS - LAWSON U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said the meeting of six major industrial nations in Paris last month agreed not to publish any bands in connection with their pact to stabilise currencies. Questioned by a parliamentary select committee about why the participating countries had not announced any bands, Lawson replied, \"we all agreed it would be much more sensible not to.\" When asked whether that meant an informal joint currency float with set ranges was arranged in Paris, Lawson said \"I do not want to reveal the precise nature of the agreement, so as not to make it easy for\" speculation against the accord. Lawson said the Paris accord presumed that individual countries would take corrective action if their currency began reacting significantly to domestic macroeconomic factors. But if such movements were due to extraneous factors, Lawson said the other pact countries would come to its aid through concerted intervention on the foreign exchanges. \"It is clear that both Germany and Japan are having difficulty adjusting to their very large exchange rate appreciations and making their economies more domestically oriented, just as it is taking time for the United States to make its own economy more export oriented,\" Lawson said. In his oral evidence to Parliament\\'s Select Treasury Committee, Lawson repeated that he was happy with the pound\\'s current level, adding that \"It is an objective ... To try to keep it around that level.\" He said the perception of sterling on foreign exchanges had changed since the steep drop in oil prices, largely because the pound had weathered that period so successfully. \"There has been a reassessment of sterling\\'s fundamentals,\" Lawson said.  He disagreed with what he termed \"the grossly exaggerated claim\" that real U.K. Interest rates were much higher than those of other major industrialsed countries. Using as a reference the key three-month sterling interbank rate as quoted in London, Lawson said Britain now had a real interest rate level of 5.75 pct - the same as Japan did and only a 0.75 percentaage point above the Group of Five average. Lawson confirmed that \"over the medium and longer term, the government\\'s objective is zero inflation.\" He said the government\\'s intention of its PSBR constant at 1.0 pct of GDP \"is the modern equivalent of the balanced budget doctrine.\"  He added that \"to allow the debt/GDP ratio to remain constant on anything other than zero inflation basis is simply a recipe for accelerating inflation.\" TREASURY BALANCES AT FED FELL ON MARCH 27 Treasury balances at the Federal Reserve fell on March 27 to 2.424 billion dlrs from 2.508 billion dlrs on the previous business day, the Treasury said in its latest budget statement. Balances in tax and loan note accounts fell to 9.706 billion dlrs from 10.786 billion dlrs on the same respective days. The Treasury\\'s operating cash balance totaled 12.131 billion dlrs on March 27 compared with 13.283 billion dlrs on March 26. U.S. CREDIT MARKETS END UNDER EXTREME PRESSURE The U.S. credit market ended under extreme pressure as the dollar\\'s continued slide on the currency markets triggered an avalanche of U.S. securities sales, pushing prices to 1987 lows, dealers and analysts said. \"This was a bloodbath,\" said one money market economist. \"We\\'ve been trading in a state of total panic at times today,\" said another. Mirroring the dollar\\'s fall to a 40-year low against the yen, the key 7-1/2 pct 30-year Treasury bond price fell nearly two points to close at 96-7/32, compared with 98-5/32 on Friday. The corresponding yield jumped to 7.83 pct from 7.66. DUTCH MONEY MARKET DEBT BARELY CHANGED IN WEEK Loans and advances from the Dutch central bank to the commercial banks were barely changed at 12.9 billion guilders in the week up to and including March 2, the central bank weekly return showed. The Treasury\\'s account with the bank dropped 1.3 billion guilders. Dealers said a larger amount of funds in the form of interest and repayments on state loans went out than came in the form of tax payments to the state. Notes in circulation rose 360 mln to 27.7 billion as the public withdrew cash to celebrate this week\\'s Carnival festival or take an end-of-winter holiday break, dealers said. Current money market rates are at 5-3/4 to 6-1/4 pct for call money against 5-1/4 to 5-3/8 a week ago, and between 5-5/16 and 5-9/16 pct against 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 for one to 12 month periods, dealers said. The cause for the rise was a rather tight 4.8 billion guilders of special advances set by the Bank yesterday compared with 8.0 billion guilders for the previous set, dealers added. They expect the money market shortage to continue around 12 billion guilders this week. The weekly return showed total Dutch gold and currency reserves rose 11.3 mln guilders to 56.0 billion guilders. BRAZIL TEMPORARILY LEGALISES DLR PARALLEL MARKET Brazilian President Jose Sarney announced a move which temporarily legalises the purchase of U.S. dollars in the parallel currency market, aimed at promoting imports of foreign goods. In a speech, Sarney justified his measure as a need to face \"current well known difficulties to obtain foreign loans for the purchase of goods.\" The parallel market, although officially tolerated, is technically illegal in Brazil. For the past year, the dollar in the parallel market has sold at between 25 and 100 pct above the official rate. Sarney\\'s decision means Brazilian importers of machinery and industrial equipment can buy dollar currency in the parallel market without having to wait for an official order from the Banco do Brasil\\'s Foreign Trade Department (Cacex). Sarney also announced measures to boost exports in an effort to strengthen the country\\'s trade balance and alleviate the risk of a reduction of foreign loans for this sector of the economy. The president authorised the National Foreign Trade Council (CONEX) to resume operating as the ruling body of Brazil\\'s trade policy, with participation of the private sector. The Council had been closed three years ago by the military government of former President Joao Figueiredo.

The Council had been closed three years ago by the military government of former President Joao Figueiredo. Tomorrow, Brazil was due to fulfill payment of 15 billion dollars in short range credit lines, but its economic officials have suggested a 60-day extension in the deadline in order to seek a renegotiation with its creditors. Sarney told members of the Council that for Brazil it is a must to recover its annual trade balance surplus to the 12 billion dollars average recorded in 1984 and 1985, and which dropped sharply last year to 8 billion dollars. He attributed the poor performance of Brazil\\'s trade balance in 1986 to protectionist moves by industrialised countries, the fall in the prices of basic goods and the crisis faced by several of Brazil\\'s Third World trade partners. U.K. MONEY MARKET OFFERED EARLY ASSISTANCE The Bank of England said it had invited an early round of bill offers from the discount houses after forecasting a very large shortage of around 1.75 billion stg in the money market today. MORE U.K. MONEY MARKET GETS 1.14 BILLION STG EARLY HELP The Bank of England said it had provided the money market with 1.143 billion mln stg assistance in response to an early round of bill offers from the discount houses. Earlier, the Bank forecast the system would face a very large deficit today of around 1.75 billion stg. The central bank purchased bank bills outright comprising 393 mln stg in band one at 9-7/8 pct, 649 mln stg in band two at 9-13/16 pct and 85 mln stg in band three at 9-3/4 pct. In addition it bought 16 mln stg of local authority bills in band two at 9-13/16 pct. BANK OF JAPAN MULLS OTHER OPTIONS TO STOP YEN RISE Today\\'s liberalised financial markets are making it extremely difficult for Japan\\'s monetary authorities to prevent the yen\\'s rise against the dollar, but they have several options other than normal intervention, Bank of Japan sources said. A senior central bank official said that such methods as controlling foreign exchange deals and invoking currency swap agreements with other central banks, which have not been invoked since 1978, are all being considered. \"But the time may not be ripe,\" he said. \"In this era of financial liberalisation, it\\'s almost impossible to control the flow of capital in and out of Japan,\" said another senior bank official. But the first official said: \"From a technical viewpoint, the Bank of Japan could activate swap agreements immediately after other central banks involved agreed to do so.\" A swap agreement, an exchange of currency between two nations, allows both sides to acquire a ready source of the other\\'s currency in case of need. \"If the Bank invokes such swaps, both parties would announce the decision jointly,\" said the first official. The sources said they believed the limit of currency market intervention may be being reached after they saw recent concerted market action by central banks of major industrial nations was increasingly ineffective in propping up the battered dollar. But intervention is at least an option, they said. Further easing of monetary policy will be very difficult with an official discount rate already at a record low of 2.5 pct, they said. Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita has repeatedly ruled out another rate cut due to fears it could revive inflation. One bank official said he could not deny the possibilty of the Bank of Japan activating currency swap agreements with the U.S. And other central banks, if these banks continue intervening to sell the yen in support of the dollar and run out of their yen cash positions. \"But we don\\'t think they have become short of yen quite yet,\" he said. The bank has established a five billion dlr swap limit with the U.S. Federal Reserve and another 2.5 billion mark and 200 billion yen limit with the West German and Swiss central banks, according to the sources. Foreign exchange dealers estimate the Fed had sold two billion dlrs worth of yen from its own account to support the dollar in New York last week. The central bank sources also said Japan may arrange other currency swap agreements with Britain and France if they find it necessary, but added they are not actually talking with each other towards that end. S. KOREA MINISTER TO VISIT U.S. FOR CURRENCY TALKS South Korea\\'s Finance Minister Chung In-yong will visit U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker next week to discuss U.S. Requests for an appreciation of South Korea\\'s won against the dollar, finance ministry officials said. They said Chung would leave for Washington on Monday to attend the International Monetary Fund\\'s (IMF) Interim Committee meeting and for talks with U.S. Officials on ways of reducing Seoul\\'s trade surplus with Washington. The dates for the Baker-Chung meeting have yet to be set. The IMF committee meeting, scheduled for April 9, is expected to review the resolution reached by the six top industrialised nations in Paris last month calling for newly industrialised countries, such as South Korea and Taiwan, to allow their currencies to rise. The official said Chung is expected to outline Seoul\\'s efforts to increase imports of U.S. Goods and to stress the need for South Korea to maintain a trade surplus in the next few years in order to cut foreign debts totalling some 44.5 billion dlrs. South Korea has ruled out a major revaluation of the won, but is allowing its currency to appreciate slowly. Trade Minister Rha Woong-bae told the U.S. Chamber of Commerce earlier this month a sudden won revaluation could result in South Korea running a large trade deficit and being forced to renege on its international debt repayments. The Bank of Korea, the central bank, today fixed the won at a two-year high of 846.90. The won has gained 5.1 pct since the beginning of 1986. South Korea\\'s trade surplus with the U.S. Rose to 7.1 billion dlrs last year from 4.3 billion in 1985. BUNDESBANK HAS NOT INTERVENED TODAY, DEALERS The Bundesbank declined to comment on rumours in Tokyo that it was intervening heavily to support the dollar, but dealers here said they had not seen the German central bank in the market all morning. The dollar was quoted at around 1.8040 marks shortly after midday in nervous but quiet trading, up from its 1.7975/85 opening. Spreads against the mark remained around 10 basis points, with some banks quoting only five point spreads. Dealers said spreads would widen and the dollar would move more sharply if the Bundesbank did intervene. UK MONEY MARKET GIVEN FURTHER 570 MLN STG HELP The Bank of England said it provided the market with a further 570 mln stg assistance during the morning after revising its estimate of the liquidity shortage to 1.85 billion stg, before taking account of its early round of bill purchases. Initially, the Bank put the likely shortage at some 1.75 billion and to help offset this gave early assistance of 1.143 billion. Its total help so far today amounts to 1.713 billion stg. MORE CALL MONEY PRESSURE FROM LARGE GERMAN BANKS One or two large West German banks effectively drained the domestic money market of liquidity at the end of the month in order to achieve higher rates from their overnight deposits, money dealers said. As a result, call money soared in active trading to around the Lombard rate of five pct from 3.70/80 pct yesterday as banks found themselves short of minimum reserve funds. Bundesbank figures showed that banks held an average daily 51 billion marks in interest-free minimum reserve assets at the central bank over the first 29 days of the month. Though this was above the March requirement of 50.7 billion, actual holdings at the weekend were 44.2 billion. To meet the daily average, dealers said, banks must raise holdings by two billion marks to 46.3 billion today and tomorrow. But liquidity was tight in early business because banks excessively took up the Bundesbank\\'s offer for sale of Treasury bills on Friday. This provides a rate of 3.50 pct for three-day deposits and is an effective floor to the market. Though some liquidity, from bills bought on Thursday, flowed back into the market today, the bulk would not return until tomorrow, the start of the new month, dealers said. Dealers said the large banks, which they did not name, commanded short-term money requirements of as much as five billion marks or so. With a knowledge of their own needs until the end of the month, the banks bought excessive amounts of treasury bills, draining liquidity for three days. When other banks sought funds, rates rose and large banks were able to place excess funds on deposit at a considerably higher average return. One senior dealer said the Bundesbank, with advanced knowledge of the market\\'s needs, should have curtailed its sales of treasury bills on Friday. Though dealers only late in the day learn of the total minimum reserve holdings of the previous day, the Bundesbank has an immediate overview of the situation and could anticipate the strength of demand for funds the following day, he said. \"(Bundesbank dealers) could easily have said we are not selling any treasury bills or we\\'re not selling them in this amount,\" he said. \"If the Bundesbank wants to finely steer the market then they should avoid such excesses. Tomorrow it will be different. Call money will fall back to 4.0 pct or so.\" But the Bundesbank would not approve of the sharp jump in rates, given the delicate state of currency markets. International central banks have been at pains to prevent a dollar fall against major currencies, including the mark. Dealers said a rise in call money gives the mark a firmer undertone, contributing to downward pressure on the dollar. \"The whole tender policy is to have a call money of between three and four pct. In that case the excesses as we have today cannot be very popular,\" the senior dealer said. Dealers said the large banks probably achieved average rates of return on their excess funds of between 3.75 pct or four pct. This is a higher return than they would have earned without the excessive draining through the treasury bill mechanism. Because of the currency situation and the wage negotiations between Germany\\'s major employers and the unions, the Bundesbank would be very unlikely to make any changes to monetary policy at its council meeting on Thursday, they said. Bundesbank figures showed that banks fell back on the Lombard emergency funding facility to draw down 1.5 billion marks yesterday as rates began to tighten in late business. BUNDESBANK HAS NOT INTERVENED TODAY, DEALERS The Bundesbank declined to comment on rumours in Tokyo that it was intervening heavily to support the dollar, but dealers here said they had not seen the German central bank in the market all morning. The dollar was quoted at around 1.8040 marks shortly after midday in nervous but quiet trading, up from its 1.7975/85 opening. Spreads against the mark remained around 10 basis points, with some banks quoting only five point spreads. Dealers said spreads would widen and the dollar would move more sharply if the Bundesbank did intervene. BANK OF JAPAN TO SELL 800 BILLION YEN IN BILLS The Bank of Japan will sell tomorrow a total of 800 billion yen worth of financing bills from its holdings to help absorb a projected money market surplus of 1,700 billion yen, money traders said. Of the total, 300 billion yen will yield 3.8992 pct on sales from money houses to banks and securities houses in a 23-day repurchase accord maturing on April 24. The remaining 500 billion yen will yield 3.8990 pct in a 31-day repurchase pact maturing on May 2, they said. The repurchase agreement yields compare with the 3.8750 pct one-month commercial bill discount rate today and the 4.28/11 pct rate on one-month certificates of deposit. Tomorrow\\'s surplus is attributable to excess bank holdings from sales of yen to buy dollars and to huge cash amounts to be redeposited at banks after the current financial year-end today, the traders said. The operation will put the outstanding bill supply at about 3,200 billion yen. U.K. MONEY MARKET SHORTAGE FORECAST REVISED UP The Bank of England said it had revised its estimate of the deficit in the money market today up to a record two billion stg, before taking account of its morning operations, from 1.85 billion at midday. The Bank has provided the system with around 1.71 billion stg assistance so far today. U.K. MONEY MARKET GIVEN FURTHER 168 MLN STG HELP The Bank of England said it had provided the money market with a further 168 mln stg assistance in the afternoon session. This takes the Bank\\'s total help so far today to 1.88 billion stg and compares with its estimate of a record two billon stg shortage in the system. The central bank purchased bank bills outright comprising 25 mln stg in band one at 9-7/8 pct, 138 mln stg in band two at 9-13/16 pct and three mln stg in band three at 9-3/4 pct. It also bought two mln stg of treasury bills in band two at 9-13/16 pct. SOUTH KOREA TO RESIST CURRENCY REVALUATION South Korean Finance Minister Chung In-yong will resist pressure for a currency revaluation to cut South Korea\\'s trade surplus with the United States when he meets Treasury Secretary James Baker next week, Finance Ministry officials said. They said Chung would leave Monday to attend the International Monetary Fund\\'s Interim Committee meeting and to hold talks with Baker and other U.S. officials on ways to reduce the surplus. The April 9 committee meeting is expected to review the agreement by six industrialized nations in Paris last month that newly-industrialized countries, such as South Korea and Taiwan, should allow their currencies to increase in value. U.K. MONEY MARKET GIVEN 215 MLN STG LATE HELP The Bank of England said it had provided the money market with late assistance of around 215 mln stg. This takes the bank\\'s total help today to some 2.096 billion stg and compares with its forecast of a two billion stg shortage in the system today. U.S. TREASURY\\'S BAKER SEES RATE STABILITY Treasury Secretary James Baker said the agreement among the industrial countries reached in Paris last month should foster stability of exchange rates at around current levels. In testimony before the House Appropriations Committee, Baker outlined many of the measures taken designed to achieve more balanced growth and a reduction of trade imbalances during the Paris meeting. \"These measures should also foster greater stability of exchange rates around current levels,\" he said. Baker reiterated that the ministers at the Paris meeting agreed that their currencies were within ranges \"broadly consistent with underlying economic fundamentals and that further substantial exchange rate shifts could damage growth and adjustment prospects.\" He added: \"In these circumstances, we agreed to cooperate closely to foster stability of exchange rates around current levels.\" TREASURY\\'S BAKER SAYS COOPERATION WORKING Treasury Secretary James Baker said that the agreement in Paris to cooperate in exchange rate changes showed that the process of coordination agreed to at the Tokyo summit was working. He told the House Appropriations Committee the meeting \"demonstrated that the process is working.\" He noted that the industrial surplus countries committed themselves to strengthen their growth prospects while the deficit countries agreed to reduce their domestic imbalances. Baker said that for its part, Japan announced a cut in its discount rate to 2.5 pct and committed itself to prepare a comprehensive economic program to stimulate domestic demand after the Diet completes action on the current budget. He said the United States must also do its share pressing for reductions in the federal budget deficit through spending cuts. \"And we must continue to oppose protectionist pressures,\" he added. DUTCH MONEY MARKET DEBT EASES IN WEEK Loans and advances from the Dutch Central Bank to the commercial banks fell 1.01 billion guilders to 9.5 billion guilders in the week ending March 30, the Bank\\'s weekly return showed. Dealers said payments by the Dutch state, partly in the form of civil service wages, had outweighed payments to the State, causing the money market deficit to ease. The Treasury\\'s account with the Bank dropped 960 mln guilders to 6.5 billion guilders. Liabilities in gold or foreign currency rose 200 mln to 11.9 billion guilders. Dealers said it was more likely that the alteration in this item on the weekly return indicated normal commercial foreign exchange business rather than intervention by the Central Bank. The Bank itself does not disclose information on intervention. Seasonal variation brought bank notes in circulation up 190 mln guilders to 29.7 billion guilders. Total gold and currency reserves rose 173 mln guilders to 56.4 billion guilders. Call money and period rates were barely changed in the week. Today all were traded at 5-3/8 to 5-1/2 pct. TREASURY\\'S BAKER SAYS U.S. REMAINS PREPARED TO FOSTER EXCHANGE RATE STABILITY TREASURY\\'S BAKER SAYS U.S. REMAINS PREPARED TO FOSTER EXCHANGE RATE STABILITY TREASURY\\'S BAKER SAYS U.S. BACKS STABILITY Treasury Secretary James Baker said the United States and the five other industrialized nations signing the recent Paris Accord remain committed to fostering the exchange rate at around current levels. But he declined to comment on what he believed to be an appropriate level of the dollar in world markets. \"I\\'m not going to comment on that because invariably the exchange markets read either more or less into my remarks than I might intend,\" he said in response to a question from the House Appropriations Committee. Baker said the six nations participating in the Paris meeting in February had \"acknowledged that the currencies are within ranges that are broadly consistent with the economic fundamentals and we and the others as well remain prepared to cooperate closely to foster stability in exchange rates around those levels.\" BANGEMANN CALLS FOR CURRENCY CALM West German Economics Minister Martin Bangemann urged a halt to the talking down of the dollar by both official and private institutions in the U.S., Saying calm was needed on the foreign exchanges. Speaking at the opening of the 40th Hanover Industry Fair, Bangemann said radical changes in foreign exchange parities had left their mark on exports and investments. He added that without these external difficulties, West Germany\\'s economy would have grown by 3.5 pct last year instead of the 2.5 pct reported. Bangemann said he could not deny that the economic climate in West Germany had cooled, but he stressed the country was not in a downtrend. The minister also criticised state subsidies, which he said mainly favoured large companies and created a tax burden for smaller and medium sized firms. Bangemann referred specifically to subsidies in the steel industry, which he said had to be fought with all legal means when they did not correspond to European Community guidelines on grants. He added that in light of the declining demand for steel capacities had to be adjusted, saying the Bonn government would not successfully be able to stand in the way of any change in this industry. Bangemann also spoke out against protectionism and called for more competition, citing as an example the Federal Post Office. The Post Office enjoys a monopoly in West Germany, especially as far as deciding who is able to provide telecommunications equipment. TREASURY\\'S BAKER PURSUING S. ASIAN REVALUATIONS Treasury Secretary James Baker told the House Appropriations Committee the United States is still pressing newly industrialized south Asian nations that have tied their currencies to the dollar to let those currencies strengthen against the dollar. \"We have seen some strengthening of those currencies (but) not as much as we would like,\" he said. \"We have been somewhat disappointed in the results so far, but we intend to continue these discussions,\" he said. SWISS MONEY MARKET PAPER YIELDS 3.286 PCT The Swiss Federal Government\\'s new series of six-month money market certificates raised 177.5 mln Swiss francs at an issue price of 98.401 pct to give an average annual yield of 3.286 pct, the National Bank said. Payment date is March 5. The last series of six-month paper issued in January raised 159.6 mln francs at 98.392 pct to give an average yield of 3.251 pct. TREASURY\\'S BAKER PURSUING S. ASIAN REVALUATIONS Treasury Secretary James Baker told the House Appropriations Committee the United States is still pressing newly industrialized south Asian nations that have tied their currencies to the dollar to let those currencies strengthen against the U.S. currency. \"We have seen some strengthening of those currencies (but) not as much as we would like,\" he said. \"We have been somewhat disappointed in the results so far, but we intend to continue these discussions,\" he said. CURRENCY FUTURES CLIMB LIKELY TO BE CHECKED The surge in currency futures since Friday on the heels of the Reagan administration\\'s proposed tariffs on Japanese imports is likely to be curtailed in the coming week, financial analysts said. \"The market is taking a breather now, and I would expect it to last a little longer,\" said Craig Sloane, a currency analyst with Smith Barney, Harris, Upham and Co. Profit-taking, which robbed the currency futures of some momentum today, is likely to continue, he said. Central banks are likely to play a role in halting the advance in currencies through intervention, the analysts said, even though the dollar fell to a 40-year low against the Japanese yen on Monday despite Bank of Japan intervention. Treasury Secretary James Baker\\'s comments that the G-6 nations remain committed to the Paris accord, coupled with his refusal to give any targets for exchange rates, provided a note of stability to the market Tuesday, the analysts said. Furthermore, Merrill Lynch Economics analyst David Horner said G-6 central banks haven\\'t yet shown the full force of their commitment to the Paris accord. \"I\\'m among those who believe the G-6 have a plan behind the scenes,\" Horner said. Horner said more forceful central bank intervention will firm the dollar and cap the rise in currency futures. \"Coordinated, punishing intervention\" by the central banks -- in contrast to the recent rolling intervention which has only smoothed out the market -- is in the offing, according to Horner. \"I think we\\'re near the top of the range in the Europeans (currencies),\" he said. On the other hand, the upside target for the yen, which set a new contract high today at 0.006916 in the June contract, is at 0.007050, Horner said. Still, other analysts believe currency futures have yet to peak. \"The basic trend in the currencies is higher,\" said Anne Parker Mills, currency analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. \"The market wants to take the dollar lower.\" Uncertainty over central bank action and nervousness over a G-5 meeting next week in advance of a meeting of the International Monetary Fund could make for choppy price activity the remainder of the week, Mills said. In addition, although the market shrugged off relatively healthy gains in February U.S. leading economic indicators and factory orders Tuesday, economic data could play a larger role in coming sessions, the analysts said. Friday\\'s employment statistics in particular will be closely watched, Sloane said, adding that a forecast rise of 250,000 in non-farm payroll jobs should underpin the dollar. U.S. FED EXPLORES COMMODITY BASKET INDEX The complex task of wielding control over monetary policy in an increasingly fast-moving global economy could be aided by tying policy to commodity prices, the newest member of the Federal Reserve Board says. Commodity prices are already considered by the Fed in the making of monetary policy. But they would be given a much greater role under an idea being floated by Governor Robert Heller, who joined the board last August. He conceeds that much more study of the idea is needed, but argues that such an arrangement, particularly if it were adopted by other major industrial countries, could reduce the volatility of exchange rates. Moreover, it could help stabilize of the prices of commodities themselves, slowing changes in inflation. His idea, which many conservative economists find appealing, has some backing among board members appointed in recent years by President Reagan. It would complement the present system of opening or closing the monetary screws based on the pattern of inflation, key indicators such as unemployment, and the rise or fall of the money supply. Changes in the money supply can lead to changes in interest rates and affect economic activity directly. Discussed on and off for a long time, the commodity concept is part of a growing search for a system that anchors monetary policy and widely-fluxtuating currency prices to a more solid base. \"What is needed is an anchor or reference point that can serve as a guide for both domestic and international monetary purposes,\" says Heller. In the past, this anchor was gold but the United States went off the gold standard because the global economy had vastly outstripped gold supplies. A return to the gold standard is generally dismissed out of hand by most policymakers on the grounds that the largest producers of gold are the Soviet Union and South Africa. The so-called fixed rate system, scuttled in the early 1970s, is still considered unworkable in the present world. But the current system of floating currencies in which currencies can fluxtuate widely, adding vast pressures to the monetary system, is also being widely questioned. Some have suggested that the system might benefit from a formal approach that mandates intervention by countries when currencies wander above or below agreed to levels but there are major problems with this also. For one thing, there is justifiable concern that countries might be relunctant to intervene if they felt it might be detrimental to their own domestic economy. Moreover, some question whether concerted intervention can make much of an inpact if the overall market does not agree with the fundamental judgement. The poorest countries have called for a monetary conference to work out a new system that, not surprisingly, helps them cope with their overpowering debt problems. Treasury Secretary James Baker, the Reagan administration\\'s chief economic architect, has preferred to use the so-called Group of Five industrial countries or sometimes, Seven, as a forum to work out cooperative agreements on currency and other economic matters. He appears convinced that officials from West Germany, France, Britain, Japan, Italy and Canada talking quietly behind closed doors can reached reasoned decisions away from public posturing. The Heller approach, while extremely complex, could have a profound impact on the system, ideally stabalizing prices and international exchange rates. As envisioned by Heller, a basket of say, 30 major commodities ranging from wheat to oil, would be put together and prices would be measured on a regular basis. \"In times of rising commodity prices, monetary policy might be tightened and in times of falling commodity prices, montary policy might be eased,\" he says. He notes that commodity prices are traded daily in auction markets, and a commodity price index can be calculated on a virtually continuous basis. Moreover, most commodity prices are produced, consumed and traded on a world-wide basis, so \"that an index has a relevance for the entire world,\" he says. In addition, commodity prices are at the beginning of the production chain and serve as an imput into virtually all production processes. \"Focusing on commodity prices as an early and sensitive indicator of current and perhaps also future prices pressures, the monetary authorities may take such an index into account in making their monetary policy decisions,\" he says. However, he says that any major change in a basic commodity such as occurred in oil during the 1970s because of action by the OPEC cartel, would have to be discounted in such a system. He says the worst thing that could happen is to allow monetary policy to spread a freakish increase in one commodity to the rest of the system and to other commodities. Bank of Japan buys dollars around 146.30 yen, dealers say Bank of Japan buys dollars around 146.30 yen, dealers say Bank of Japan intervenes buying dollars at around 147.30 yen - dealers Bank of Japan intervenes buying dollars at around 147.30 yen - dealers BANK OF JAPAN INTERVENES IN EARLY TOKYO AFTERNOON The Bank of Japan intervened in the market in the early afternoon, buying dollars around 147.30 yen and continuing to buy them as high as 147.50 yen, dealers said. The Bank intervened just after the dollar started rising on buying by securities houses at around 147.05 yen, and hoped to accelerate the dollar\\'s advance, they said. The dollar rose as high as 147.50 yen. SEIPP SAYS GERMAN INTEREST RATES SHOULD FALL The Bundesbank should take further steps to reduce German interest rates to protect the mark from further appreciation and to persuade investors to bring long-term yields lower, Commerzbank AG &lt;CBKG.F> management board chairman Walter Seipp said. But he told the bank\\'s annual news conference this did not mean a cut in leading interest rates, rather a reduction in money market rates through bringing the allocation rates down for Bundesbank securities repurchase agreements. \"Leading interest rates are not the decisive rates,\" he said. \"The money market rates are the important ones.\" Seipp said the Bundesbank should move away from allocating money market liquidity at a fixed 3.8 pct as it has in recent tender allocations. An easier monetary policy would not mean a loss of credibility for the Bundesbank in its containment of monetary growth. A fall in short rates would make the public aware of the high yields in bonds and lead to a longer-term capital formation, braking the expansion of money supply. \"Thus, you can have lower rates and also a normalisation of monetary growth both at the same time,\" he added. Seipp said there were no grounds to paint too black a picture of the German economy, since company profitability had improved over recent years and domestic oriented firms were profiting from cheaper imports because of the rise in the mark. Growth this year should be at least one pct, he said, describing the downturn in production in the first months as a false start, unrepresentative of the rest of the year. After an economic contraction in the first quarter, the economy should show an uptrend in the last three. \"We don\\'t believe that the economy has tipped over, but see it more as a \\'growth dip,\\'\" Seipp said. But Seipp also called for support for growth from fiscal policy, saying the top rate of income and corporate tax should be brought down to 49 pct. The current peak rate is 56 pct. The additional tax cuts brought forward to next January were no substitute for support for growth. Seipp added the federal government should make \"further courageous steps to decrease the state\\'s proportion of the German economy and to increase its flexibility.\" CURRENCY INSTABILITY WILL NOT LAST - SUMITA Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita said the present foreign exchange market instability will not last long as there is caution in the market regarding the rapid decline of the U.S. Unit. He told reporters the major currency nations are determined to continue their concerted intervention whenever necessary to stave off speculative dollar selling in line with their February 22 currency stability agreement in Paris. Sumita also said he did not see the recent dollar drop as anything like a free-fall. U.K. MONEY MARKET OFFERED EARLY ASSISTANCE The Bank of England said it had invited an early round of bill offers from the discount houses after forecasting a shortage of around 1.2 billion stg in the money market today. Among the main factors affecting liquidity, bills for repurchase by the market will drain some 526 mln stg while bills maturing in official hands and the take-up of treasury bills will remove around 1.79 billion stg. A rise in note circulation will take out a further 105 mln stg. Partly offsetting these outflows, exchequer transactions will add around 1.01 billion stg and bankers\\' balances above target some 185 mln stg. U.K. MONEY MARKET GIVEN 689 MLN STG EARLY HELP The Bank of England said it had provided the money market with early assistance of 689 mln stg in response to an early round of bill offers from the discount houses. This compares with the Bank\\'s estimate that the system would face a shortage of around 1.2 billion stg today. The central bank made outright purchases of bank bills comprising 347 mln stg in band one at 9-7/8 pct, 207 mln stg in band two at 9-13/16 pct and 135 mln stg in band three at 9-3/4 pct. GERMAN CALL MONEY DROPS BACK AT MONTH START Call money rates fell to 3.85/95 pct from five pct yesterday in moderate trading as month end tightness disappeared and operators took positions for April. Dealers said they expected rates to remain within a 3.70 to four pct range this month. A minor tax payment period on behalf of customers mid-month, the long Easter weekend and pension payments were unlikely to tighten rates significantly. Next Wednesday, 14.9 billion marks are leaving the system on the expiry of a securities repurchase pact. But dealers said they expected the Bundesbank to fully replace the outflow with a new tender at a fixed rate of 3.80 pct. Commerzbank AG\\'s management board chairman Walter Seipp called on the Bundesbank to reduce interest rates to protect the mark through bringing the allocation rate for securities repurchase agreements down. But dealers said the Bundesbank was unlikely to ease credit policies at the moment. There was little domestic and foreign pressure for lower rates and no signs of a change. Yesterday one or two large West German banks effectively drained the domestic money market of liquidity in order to achieve higher rates from their overnight deposits, dealers said. Bundesbank figures showed banks held an average daily 50.7 billion marks in minimum reserves at the central bank over the first 30 days of March, the exact requirement needed just one day before the end of the month. Actual holdings on Monday were 42.0 billion marks. Because rates soared to the level of the Lombard emergency funding rate yesterday, banks fell back on the loan facility to draw down a high 5.3 billion marks in an attempt to meet Bundesbank needs, the data showed. U.K. MONEY MARKET SHORTAGE FORECAST REVISED UP The Bank of England said it had revised its estimate of the shortage in the money market up to 1.3 billion stg from 1.2 billion before taking account of its early operations. The Bank has provided 689 mln stg assistance so far today. CURRENCY INSTABILITY WILL NOT LAST - SUMITA Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita said the present foreign exchange market instability will not last long as there is caution in the market regarding the rapid decline of the U.S. Unit. He told reporters the major currency nations are determined to continue their concerted intervention whenever necessary to stave off speculative dollar selling in line with their February 22 currency stability agreement in Paris. Sumita also said he did not see the recent dollar drop as anything like a free-fall. U.K. MONEY MARKET DEFICIT REVISED DOWNWARDS The Bank of England said it has revised its estimate of today\\'s shortfall to around 1.25 billion stg from 1.3 billion before taking account of 775 mln stg morning assistance. FED BUYING ONE BILLION DLRS OF BILLS FOR CUSTOMER ACCOUNT, FED SAYS FED BUYING ONE BILLION DLRS OF BILLS FOR CUSTOMER ACCOUNT, FED SAYS TURKISH CENTRAL BANK SETS LIRA/DOLLAR, DM RATES The Turkish Central Bank set a lira/dollar rate for April 2 of 780.00/783.90 to the dollar, down from the previous 777.00/780.89. The Bank also set a lira/mark rate of 429.15/431.30 to the mark, up from the previous 430.50/432.65. FED BUYS ONE BILLION DLRS OF BILLS FOR CUSTOMER The Federal Reserve is buying one billion dlrs of Treasury bills for customer account for delivery today, a spokesman for the bank said. Fed funds were trading at 6-3/16 pct at the time of the purchase, which came several hours before the Fed normally transacts business for its customers. Economists said the purchase was almost certainly related to the investment of proceeds from recent central bank intervention in the foreign exchanges. The Bank of Japan alone is estimated to have bought about six billion dlrs in March in a bid to prop up the dollar. FINLAND REVISES CURRENCY BASKET The Bank of Finland said it has revised the weightings in its currency basket with effect from today. Weightings  match the respective country\\'s share in Finland\\'s foreign trade. Weights in percentages compared with former weights. Dollar  9.0 (8.8) Sterling 14.3 (13.8) Swedish crown 20.4 (20.6) Norwegian crown 5.2 (5.2) Danish crown 5.2 (5.3) German mark 19.3 (19.6) REUTER^M LAWSON WANTS STERLING AROUND 1.60 DLRS, 2.90 MKS U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said he wanted sterling to stay roughly where it was, specifying a rate of around 2.90 marks and 1.60 dlrs. He told the National Economic Development Council that the recent Paris meeting of major industrialised nations had agreed on the need for exchange rate stability. There was now a \"reasonable alignment of currencies\" and the U.K. Government intended to keep sterling at about its present level, he said. That meant around 2.90 marks, which is the single most important rate to concentrate on, and 1.60 dlrs, Lawson said. His disclosure of two of the key targets for sterling was highly unusual, foreign exchange market analysts said. In the past he has preferred to be less definite about the Government\\'s exchange rate policy, lest it give foreign exchange markets set limits to test. Lawson told the committee, which is a tripartite forum of government, unions and industry, that the pound would be kept near its present level by a mixture of interest rates and intervention in the foreign exchange markets. The pound finished trading here today at 1.6040/50 dlrs and 2.9210/45 marks. His disclosure of two of the key targets for sterling was highly unusual, foreign exchange market analysts said.

CURRENCY INTERVENTION TIMING CRUCIAL - ANALYSTS The dollar\\'s recent decline, despite massive central bank purchases, is a forceful reminder that official intervention in the foreign exchanges can work only if it is well-timed to coincide with shifts in market fundamentals or sentiment, dealers and analysts said. Central banks may succeed in slowing a trend, but, without accompanying policy changes, they stand little chance of reversing the direction of an ever-growing global market in which more than 200 billion dlrs is traded every day, the sources said. \"Timing and psychology are the key to successful intervention,\" said Jim O\\'Neill, a financial markets economist with Marine Midland Banks Inc. The importance of complementary changes in economic fundamentals was underlined yesterday when a change in interest rates boosted the dollar, instantly achieving what the central banks had tried in vain to do for a week through open market intervention. After Citibank raised its prime rate by a quarter-point to 7-3/4 pct, the first change in the rate since last August, the dollar started to advance and reached a high in Tokyo of 147.50 yen, up two yen from Tuesday\\'s New York low. By contrast, monetary authorities spearheaded by the Bank of Japan are estimated to have bought as much as 10 billion dlrs in the last 10 days of March but could not prevent the dollar from skidding through 150 yen and plumbing a 40-year low Monday of 144.70 yen. Some experts worry the central banks have lost more than just a temporary battle to prop up the dollar. The market is wary of being caught wrong-footed by a central bank foray, but is no longer mesmerized. \"They\\'ve lost their credibility. The market feels it can take on the central banks and win,\" said Michael Snow, head of treasury operations at Union Bank of Switzerland in New York. The relative failure of recent intervention stands in sharp contrast to the success that central banks scored when they joined forces to drive the dollar down following the September 22, 1985, Plaza accord. Then, however, central banks had an easy time of it, because the markets and the Treasuries of the major industrial powers were agreed that the dollar needed to head lower to redress massive worldwide trade imbalances. Now, there is no such consensus. The market is saying that the dollar must fall further because the U.S. trade deficit is showing little sign of improvement, while Japan is resisting in a bid to protect its export industries. For its part, the United States is apparently content to let the dollar fall gradually further and is paying little more than lip service to the February Paris agreement of the Group of Five plus Canada to foster stability, dealers say. Specifically, they said the Fed\\'s dollar-buying intervention has been half-hearted, designed more as a political gesture to Japan than to strike fear into the markets. \"It\\'s been pro-forma intervention,\" said Francoise Soares-Kemp, chief corporate trader at Credit Lyonnais. Because of this discord and the market\\'s momentum for a lower dollar, analysts said intervention looks doomed to fail. \"It\\'s going to take a lot more than the central banks to hold the dollar (at these levels),\" said Snow, who predicts another 10 to 15 pct depreciation. \"There have to be structural changes that occur to make the market stop selling dollars,\" added \"Buying six billion dollars in three weeks is not going to do it.\" Late last decade during the presidency of Jimmy Carter, when the dollar was last under heavy speculative attack, central banks sometimes intervened to the tune of six billion dlrs in a single day but still failed to stop the dollar falling to a record low of 1.70 marks, analysts said. Snow said purchases on that scale now are unlikely. \"I don\\'t think anybody has the stomach for it, because they saw the futility of it in the seventies.\" Indeed, because the market has grown in leaps and bound since then, intervention on an even greater scale would probably be needed to impress the market. Trading volume in London, New York and Tokyo alone last year averaged nearly 188 billion dlrs a day, according to a joint central bank study, about double the previous estimate made just two years earlier by the Group of Thirty private research group. There are signs that central banks, too, realize the futility of swimming against the tide. Bank of Japan sources told Reuters in Tokyo earlier this week that they believed the limits of currency market intervention are perhaps being reached and that other methods for bolstering the dollar, such as invoking currency swap agreements with other central banks, are being considered. \"In this era of financial liberalization, it\\'s almost impossible to control the flow of capital in and out of Japan,\" one senior official in Tokyo said. CHIRAC SAYS FRANCE RESOLVED TO SUPPORT CURRENCY PACT French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac said that on financial issues, the United States and France had \"very close\" views, and he said Treasury Secretary James Baker was determined to support the February 22 Paris agreement on stabilizing foreign exchange parities. \"I was very reassured by the determination of Mr. Baker to support this agreement,\" he said. He described the dollar\\'s sharp fall against the yen at the start of the week as a \"passing incident\" and added, \"Everyone is resolved to support the Paris accord.\" Questioned about his plan to help the world\\'s poorest countries, Chirac said he did not envisage any large-scale debt write-offs. \"I don\\'t think we can talk of write-offs - even the poorest countries have not asked for that,\" he said. Chirac said he wanted commercial banks to give third world countries better terms in rescheduling their debts, and for the International Monetary Fund to soften its conditions. \"One cannot pity the banks - they bear a lot of responsibility due to the encouragement they gave to these countries to take on debts. Now the banks are complaining but I do not weep for them.\" FED SAYS IT BUYS 550 MLN DLRS OF BILLS FOR CUSTOMER, MAY THROUGH SEPT 24 MATURITY FED SAYS IT BUYS 550 MLN DLRS OF BILLS FOR CUSTOMER, MAY THROUGH SEPT 24 MATURITY FED BUYS 550 MLN DLRS OF BILLS FOR CUSTOMER The Federal Reserve bought about 550 mln dlrs of U.S. Treasury bills for a customer, a spokeswoman said. She said the Fed bought bills maturing from May through September 24 for regular delivery tomorrow. Federal funds were trading at 6-3/16 pct when the Fed announced the operation. WORLD RECESSION UNLIKELY - DEUTSCHE\\'S HERRHAUSEN A world recession is unlikely this year as fiscal and monetary policy in most industrialized countries is supporting the economy, Deutsche Bank AG &lt;DBKG.F> management board joint spokesman Alfred Herrhausen said. But growth rates will be smaller than last year, with 1.5 to 2.5 pct likely in most industrialized countries, he told a news conference. Herrhausen said he was confident private consumption would support economic growth in West Germany this year, with net income increases turning into purchasing power as long as inflation did not revive. Herrhausen said he did not expect interest rates to rise in West Germany this year, but there was little room for further falls. Rates in the U.S. were however rising, as evidenced by the latest prime rate moves, but this rise would be moderate. Herrhausen said he did not expect any major narrowing of the U.S. Trade and budget deficits in the next few months. One success of the Paris agreement in February to foster currency stability was that U.S. Officials have stopped talking down the dollar, he noted. The recent stability would last until markets decided to test the resolve of central banks, he said. He noted that central banks had spent some 10 billion dlrs this week to stabilize the dollar against the yen in the first such test. \"A massive attack on the mark, which could come if we get bad news out of the U.S., Would require a much higher intervention amount, raising the danger of inflation,\" he said. Turning to the international debt problem, Herrhausen said Brazil\\'s unilateral debt moratorium had surprised banks. But the move showed that a real solution to debt problems was only possible with the involvement of all parties. U.K. MONEY RATES HARDEN ON LAWSON CURRENCY TARGETS Money market rates rates showed a harder edge after news U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson has set a target for the pound against the mark and dollar, to be maintained by a mixture of interest rates and intervention in the foreign exchange markets. Dealers said the market was surprised by the Chancellor\\'s disclosure of sterling target rates, around 2.90 marks and 1.60 dlrs, and nervous over the implications for domestic interest rates, further reducing the propects for a near term cut in U.K. Bank base rates. The key three months interbank sterling rate gained 1/16 point at 10 9-7/8 pct. The pound opened three basis points lower at 71.3 in trade weighted terms, at around 1.59 dlrs and 2.91 marks. BANK OF FRANCE TO BUY FIRST CATEGORY PAPER TODAY The Bank of France is to inject liquidity against first category paper at a tender this afternoon, a Bank spokesman said. Money market sources were divided as to whether they thought the Bank of France would use the occasion to cut its intervention rate, which has stood at 7 3/4 pct since it was cut from eight pct on March 9. Some thought a rate cut unlikely given foreign exchange turbulence and the U.S. Prime rate rise to 7 3/4 pct, while others still counted on a 1/4 point cut by the Bank of France. U.K. MONEY MARKET DEFICIT FORECAST AT 800 MLN STG The Bank of England said it forecast a shortage of around 800 mln stg in the money market today. Among the main factors affecting liquidity, bills for repurchase by the market will drain some 664 mln stg while bills maturing in official hands and the take-up of treasury bills will take out around 508 mln stg and a rise in note circulation some 45 mln stg. Partly offsetting these outflows, exchequer transactions and bankers\\' balances above target will add some 380 mln stg and 35 mln stg to the system respectively. RISING TAIWAN DOLLAR CAUSES FOREIGN RESERVES LOSS Taiwan said its foreign reserves suffered about 3.4 billion U.S. Dlrs in exchange rate losses from July 1986 to February 1987 as a result of the rise of the Taiwan dollar against the U.S. Currency. Yu Chien-ming, head of the government statistics department, told parliament yesterday he expected the losses to increase as the Taiwan dollar continues to strengthen. The Taiwan dollar, which opened at 34.24 to the U.S. Dollar today, has risen about 16 pct against the U.S. Unit since September 1985. Some bankers expect it to rise to 33 by June and to 32 by the end of this year. Taiwan\\'s foreign exchange reserves now total 53 billion dlrs. At end-February they were 52.1 billion dlrs, the world\\'s third largest after West Germany and Japan. Yu said the interest earned from the reserves totalled about 1.68 billion U.S. Dlrs from July 1986 to February 1987. The reserves are managed by the central bank and deposited at about 170 leading banks in the U.S., Japan, Britain, Canada and Singapore. About 75 pct of the reserves are in the form of cash, mostly in U.S. Dollars. The rest are in government treasury bills, certificates of deposit and bonds. U.K. MONEY RATES FIRM ON LAWSON STERLING TARGETS Interest rates on the London money market were slightly firmer on news U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson had stated target rates for sterling against the dollar and mark, dealers said. They said this had come as a surprise and expected the targets, 2.90 marks and 1.60 dlrs, to be promptly tested in the foreign exchange markets. Sterling opened 0.3 points lower in trade weighted terms at 71.3. Dealers noted the chancellor said he would achieve his goals on sterling by a combination of intervention in currency markets and interest rates. Operators feel the foreign exchanges are likely to test sterling on the downside and that this seems to make a fall in U.K. Base lending rates even less likely in the near term, dealers said. The feeling remains in the market, however, that fundamental factors have not really changed and that a rise in U.K. Interest rates is not very likely. The market is expected to continue at around these levels, reflecting the current 10 pct base rate level, for some time. The key three months interbank rate was 1/16 point firmer at 10 9-7/8 pct. JAPAN MINISTRY ASKS TRUST BANKS TO CUT DLR SALES The Finance Ministry has asked trust banks to moderate their dollar selling, trust banking sources said. A Ministry official told Reuters earlier this week the Ministry had recently surveyed foreign exchange transactions by institutional investors, but he declined to say whether this was aimed at moderating the dollar sales. Dealers said institutional investors were reluctant to sell dollars aggressively today partly because of the Ministry monitoring. One senior trust bank source said that while sympathizing with the Ministry position, the trust banks had to conduct their foreign exchange operations according to the dictates of the market. A Bank of Japan official said the central bank approved of the survey as long it was not used too forcefully. But another official denied local press reports that the central bank itself had asked investors to moderate their dollar sales. \"We are not legally authorized to do that,\" he said. A Bank of Japan official also said the central bank will renew its call on financial institutions to moderate excessive loans for the purpose of land and securities investment as such investments threaten to cause inflation. Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita had previously expressed concern about excessive investment in land and securities resulting partly from eased credit conditions. JAPAN ASKS BANKS TO MODERATE DOLLAR SALES - JIJI The Finance Ministry has asked commercial banks to moderate their dollar sales, JiJi News Agency reported, quoting financial sources. Finance Ministry officials were unavailable for comment. The report also could not be confirmed by several bank dealers. Earlier, Japanese trust banking sources said the Ministry had asked them to moderate their dollar sales. A Ministry official said earlier this week the ministry had recently surveyed currency transactions by investors, but declined to say whether this aimed at reducing their dollar sales. LAWSON REMARKS DASH HOPES OF EARLY U.K. RATE CUT Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson\\'s remarks yesterday suggesting there are precise exchange rate targets for the pound undermined sterling, dashing hopes for an early cut in U.K. Base rates, analysts said. But the market\\'s reaction, testing exchange rate levels indicated by Lawson, was probably overdone and the longer term outlook for sterling remained bullish, they agreed. In an apparent break with the previous policy of secrecy, Lawson told a National Economic Development Council meeting he was comfortable with sterling exchange rates around current levels, specifying rates of around 1.90 marks and 1.60 dlrs. Lawson added the U.K. Government intended to keep sterling at about present levels, using currency intervention and interest rates to achieve this. The February 22 Paris agreement of the Group of Five and Canada to stabilise exchange rates is widely believed to include target ranges, but all participants to the meeting had so far refused to specify these. Markets were quick to react to the statement, chopping about one U.S. Cent and over one pfennig off the pound to match the levels mentioned by Lawson. But most analysts polled said they did not believe Lawson\\'s statement signalled a change in U.K. Policy. Keith Skeoch, chief economist at stockbrokers James Capel and Co, said, \"the remarks have been blown out of proportion. Lawson is paying now for a little bit of a slip of the tongue.\" Barclays de Zoete Wedd economist Mark Brett said, \"there is nothing great and fantastic in the Chancellor\\'s statement.\" He said he did not believe the rates indicated by the Chancellor were precise targets, but merely represented central rates around which sterling would be allowed to fluctuate, perhaps by as much as 10 pct. \"It would be insane to pinpoint an exchange rate ahead of an election ... I don\\'t believe Lawson is mad enough to tie himself to a fixed rate,\" Brett said. Currency markets were keen for official statements to clarify the scope of the Paris accord and reactivate currency trading. This mood easily led to over-reaction, analysts said. \"Making similar statements when the market is high strung and ready to bounce is perhaps a mistake,\" one senior dealer with a U.S. Bank said. Capel\\'s Skeoch said, \"it gives the foreign exchange markets something to shoot at.\" \"It is obvious that the government, as a member of the Group of Six, has agreed exchange rate bands. But they are not cut in stone, they can change with time,\" Skeoch said. Brett said, \"we think the 2.90 marks level is a central rate. Give or take 10 pfennigs and all is fine.\" Not all analysts played down the significance of the remarks, however. Chris Dunn, economist at Royal Bank of Canada, said the remarks may signal a decisive move to insulate sterling from the fortunes of the dollar. Although about two-thirds of Britain\\'s trade is conducted with European countries, sterling has traditionally shadowed the dollar rather than the mark, analysts noted. \"Britain must decide whether it wants to follow the U.S. Or throw in its lot with Europe,\" Dunn said. \"It suggests that while the U.K. Is not actually applying to join the European Monetary System, it is seeking protection by shadowing it ... The Bundesbank has made it clear that it wants the U.K. To clarify its position relative to the mark,\" he said. Analysts said sterling\\'s dip on currency markets following Lawson\\'s remarks made an early half-point cut in U.K. Base rates from current 10 pct levels unlikely in the short term. \"Over the next three weeks, a cut is out, unless we get some extremely good economic indicators,\" Capel\\'s Skeoch said. Base rates have been cut twice by one-half point in March, the last after the March 17 budget presentation, and analysts had been expecting another half point cut shortly afterwards. U.K. MONEY MARKET GIVEN 345 MLN STG ASSISTANCE The Bank of England said it had provided the money market with 345 mln stg help in the morning session. This compares with its forecast of a shortage of around 800 mln stg in the system today. The central bank made outright purchases of bank bills comprising 58 mln stg in band one at 9-7/8 pct, 227 mln stg in band two at 9-13/16 pct, 56 mln stg in band three at 9-3/4 pct and four mln stg in band four at 9-11/16 pct. Dealers noted that this was the first time bills in band four, which have a maturity of between two and three months, have been dealt in the market since mid-February. BUNDESBANK LEAVES CREDIT POLICIES UNCHANGED The Bundesbank left credit policies unchanged after today\\'s regular meeting of its council, a spokesman said in answer to enquiries. The West German discount rate remains at 3.0 pct, and the Lombard emergency financing rate at 5.0 pct. BANK OF JAPAN INTERVENES JUST AFTER TOKYO OPENING The Bank of Japan intervened just after the Tokyo market opened, buying dollars at around 147.65 yen, dealers said. They were unsure of the amount of the central bank\\'s purchasing, but it seemed to prevent the dollar from weakening against the yen amid bearish sentiment for the U.S. Currency, they said. The dollar opened at 147.65 yen against 147.20/30 in New York and 146.90 at the close here yesterday. BUNDESBANK LEAVES CREDIT POLICIES UNCHANGED The Bundesbank left credit policies unchanged after today\\'s regular meeting of its council, a spokesman said in answer to enquiries. The West German discount rate remains at 3.0 pct, and the Lombard emergency financing rate at 5.0 pct. U.K. MONEY MARKET GIVEN FURTHER 152 MLN STG HELP The Bank of England said it had given the money market a further 152 mln stg assistance in the afternoon session. This takes the Bank\\'s total help so far today to 497 mln stg and compares with its forecast of a shortage in the system of around 700 mln stg which it earlier revised down from 800 mln. The central bank made outright purchases of bank bills comprising 34 mln stg in band one at 9-7/8 pct, 39 mln stg in band two at 9-13/16 pct, 51 mln stg in band three at 9-3/4 pct and 28 mln stg in band four at 9-11/16 pct. BANK OF FRANCE LEAVES INTERVENTION RATE UNCHANGED The Bank of France said it left its intervention rate unchanged at 7-3/4 pct when it injected funds to the market against first category paper in todays money market intervention tender. Money market dealers had earlier expressed mixed views on a possible quarter point cut. The rate was last adjusted on March 9, when it was reduced to 7-3/4 pct from the eight pct rate set in January. TURKISH CENTRAL BANK SETS LIRA/DOLLAR, DM RATES Turkey\\'s Central Bank set a lira/dollar rate for April 3 of 782.50/786.41 to the dollar, down from 780.00/783.90. It set a lira/D-mark rate of 428.30/430.44 to the mark, up from 429.15/431.30. U.K. MONEY MARKET GIVEN 40 MLN STG LATE HELP The Bank of England said it had provided the money market with around 40 mln stg late assistance. This takes the Bank\\'s total help today to some 537 mln stg and compares with its estimate of a 700 mln stg shortage. NEW DUTCH SPECIAL ADVANCES UNCHANGED AT 5.3 PCT The Dutch central bank announced new 12-day special advances at an unchanged rate of 5.3 pct to cover money market tightness for the period April 3 to 15. The amount will be set at tender on April 3 between 0700 and 0730 hours GMT. The new facility replaces the current 4.2 billion guilders of nine-day advances which expire tomorrow. Money market dealers said the rate for the new advances was in line with expectations. They added they expect the Bank to allocate between 4.0 and 4.5 billion guilders. Lawson says his sterling target comments were misunderstood, and insignificant Lawson says his sterling target comments were misunderstood, and insignificant LAWSON SAYS HIS STERLING-TARGET COMMENTS WERE MISUNDERSTOOD AND INSIGNIFICANT LAWSON SAYS HIS STERLING-TARGET COMMENTS WERE MISUNDERSTOOD AND INSIGNIFICANT NEW DUTCH ADVANCES TOTAL 4.1 BILLION GUILDERS The Duth Central bank said it accepted bids totalling 4.086 billion guilders at tender for the new twelve-day special advances at an unchanged 5.3 pct. Bids up to 30 mln guilders were met in full, amounts above at 40 pct. The new advances, covering the period April 3 to 15, replace the current 4.2 billion guilder nine-day facility at 5.3 pct, which expires today. Money market dealers said the total amount allocated was in line with expectations and would be sufficient to cover the money market shortage for the duration of the facility. U.K. MONEY MARKET DEFICIT FORECAST AT 700 MLN STG The Bank of England said it has forecast a shortage of around 700 mln stg in the system today. Among the main factors, maturing assistance and take-up of treasury bills will drain 546 mln stg, bills for repurchase by the market 76 mln, a rise in note circulation 310 mln and bankers balances below target 105 mln. The outflow will be partly offset by 340 mln stg exchequer transactions. NO INTERVENTION, DOLLAR FIXED AT 1.8162 MARKS The Bundesbank did not intervene as the dollar was fixed lower at 1.8162 marks after 1.8270 yesterday, dealers said. The dollar firmed slightly from its opening 1.8135/45 marks in very quiet pre-weekend trading and dealers said they expected business to remain thin this afternoon. \"Trading is at an absolute nil, nobody wants to get involved ahead of next week\\'s meetings,\" one dealer with a U.S. Bank said, referring to the Group of Seven industrial nations and the International Monetary Fund meetings in Washington. Dealers saw the dollar staying at current levels but possibly rising above 1.83 marks on any supporting remarks emerging from the meetings. \"But the dollar\\'s medium-term direction is soft,\" one dealer said. The dollar could well come under renewed pressure after the international forums as attention returned to the U.S. And the U.K.\\'s trade dispute with Japan, dealers said. Cross currency trading was also subdued though sterling\\'s rise above 1.60 dlrs helped it to firm against the mark. It was fixed higher at 2.924 marks after yesterday\\'s 2.910. The pound was seen staying between 2.90 and 2.93 marks for the next days, dealers said. Eurodollar deposit rates were steady from this morning, with six month funds unchanged at midpoint 6-11/16 pct. Six month euromarks stayed at midpoint 3-7/8 pct. The Swiss franc firmed to 119.86 marks per 100 at the fix from 119.71 yesterday and the yen rose to 1.244 marks per 100 from 1.243. The French franc was little changed at 30.050 marks per 100 after 30.055 yesterday. U.K. MONEY MARKET DEFICIT REVISED UPWARD The Bank of England said it has revised its estimate of today\\'s shortfall to 750 mln stg from 700 mln. U.K. MONEY MARKET RECEIVES 170 MLN STG HELP The Bank of England said it has operated in the money market this morning, purchasing 170 mln stg bank bills. This compares with the Bank\\'s revised estimate of a 750 mln stg shortfall. In band two the Bank bought 72 mln stg at 9-13/16 pct, in band three 52 mln at 9-3/4 pct and in band four 46 mln at 9-11/16 pct. STOLTENBERG SAYS PARIS ACCORD POLICY TO CONTINUE West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said the currency agreement reached in Paris in February had been successful and would be continued. Stoltenberg told journalists before he attends next week\\'s International Monetary Fund meeting in Washington that: \"The ... Strategy to stabilise currencies around current levels has proven its worth and will also determine future developments.\" Stoltenberg declined to comment specifically on what he would consider to be an undervalued dollar but said a dollar around 1.80 marks created problems for West Germany\\'s exports. Stoltenberg said studies by international organisations had made it clear that especially in the U.S. And in Japan major efforts remained necessary to support adjustments in foreign trade balances via necessary corrections to economic policy. \"No-one would benefit if, after years of over-valuation, the U.S. Dollar fell into the other extreme, that is, strong under-valuation,\" he said. Stoltenberg said West Germany had a keen interest in a swift agreement between the U.S. And Japan concerning the current trade dispute over semi-conductors. Asked whether he believed the markets would test the Paris currency accord, Stoltenberg did not comment specifically but noted that much of what had been discussed in Paris had not been published. The Paris declaration did not state the levels at which central banks of the major industrialised countries would intervene. Stoltenberg said that everything had been carefully considered. He said he had nothing further to add. Stoltenberg also appeared to suggest that West Germany was now no longer under any pressure from the U.S. Government to stimulate its economy. He declined to respond specifically to a question on this subject but said, \"You must attach particular importance to the consensus which was reached in Paris.\" The minister nevertheless added that he would make clear during his trip to Washington that West Germany\\'s nominal trade figures gave a false impression about actual trade flows. Stoltenberg noted that in 1986 Bonn\\'s exports fell by a nominal two pct while its nominal imports fell by 10.7 pct. West Germany\\'s imports dropped largely because of foreign currency developments and the cheaper price of oil and led to a record trade surplus last year. However, Stoltenberg said that in real terms West Germany\\'s exports by volume had increased by 1.5 pct while real imports had risen by a much stronger 6.2 pct. In this way West Germany had made its contribution to economic stability, Stoltenberg added. Stoltenberg noted the government expected imports to rise by a real four to five pct in 1987 with exports stagnating. He said it was too early to revise official forecasts for West Germany\\'s economic growth this year. The government has forecast an unchanged 2.5 pct rise in Gross National Product. The Kiel Institute, a leading research body, is still expecting growth of three pct but some other research institutes have revised forecasts down to below two pct. Stoltenberg said the wide range of predictions showed how many imponderables had to be taken into account and said no drastic changes in official forecasts were needed. JAPAN ASKS BANKS TO CUT DOLLAR SALES - DEALERS The Finance Ministry has asked Japanese commercial banks to moderate their dollar sales, bank dealers said. They said the Ministry had telephoned city and long-term banks earlier this week to make the request. One dealer said this was the first time the Ministry had made such a request to commercial banks. Finance Ministry officials were unavailable for immediate comment. Dealers said the Ministry has already asked institutional investors to reduce their sales of the dollar. GERMAN NET CURRENCY RESERVES RISE West German net currency reserves rose by 200 mln marks in the fourth week of March to 82.2 billion, following a rise of 300 mln marks in the previous week, the Bundesbank said. Non-currency reserves were unchanged at about 2.5 billion marks, bringing net monetary reserves to 84.7 billion. U.S. TREASURY POLICIES SAID UNCHANGED BY DEPARTURE The departure of James Baker\\'s closest aide, Deputy Treasury Secretary Richard Darman, will not change the course of Washington\\'s domestic and international economic policies, U.S. officials said. Darman, who has worked alongside Baker for six years, was widely credited with helping him mastermind initiatives on currency management and international economic cooperation. U.S. Officials said Darman also played a key role in shepherding President Reagan\\'s sweeping tax reform plan through the U.S. Congress. But they flatly dismissed suggestions that his departure, to the investment banking firm of Shearson Lehman Brothers, signaled the Baker team was breaking up, or that the Treasury Secretary himself might leave soon. \"It really does not mean that, he took the opportunity as it came up,\" one official said. Another commented, \"Baker will miss him, but he\\'s not going to stand in his way.\" There has been widespread speculation since last autumn that Darman sought a Wall Street job. Officials said Darman felt the passage of tax reform late last year marked an appropriate moment to bow out. Baker acknowledged Darman would be sorely missed. \"Dick Darman has contributed mightily to the success of this administration over the past six years and his departure represents a substantial loss,\" he said. U.S. Officials admitted Darman\\'s absence would be an undoubted blow to Baker, who has relied on him for policy advice, both at the White House and, in Reagan\\'s second term, at the Treasury. One aide once described Darman as \"indispensable\" to Baker. Baker is widely thought to want a more stable currency system and Darman is generally credited by officials of other nations as Baker\\'s leading theorist on this issue, favouring target zones to limit currency fluctuations. Earlier this year, monetary sources said the U.S. Treasury unsuccessfully sounded out allies on a target zone system. But a U.S. Official disputed the assessment that, with Darman gone, Baker would abandon international initiatives. Baker\\'s work as head of Reagan\\'s Economic Policy Council, spearheading trade policy, and his skills in negotiating with the Democrat-controlled Congress will go on as before. Darman\\'s strength was not as an economist, but as a political strategist \"and that\\'s Baker\\'s strength too,\" the official said. There were already indications that Baker, who throughout his time in government has relied on a closely-knit circle of advisers, has moved swiftly to find a successor. One possibility is that Baker might turn to George Gould, who holds the number three Treasury position of Under-Secretary. Gould, another close confidante, has known Baker for years. Before joining the Treasury in November 1985, Gould was a partner at the Wall Steet firm of Wertheim and Co and formerly headed Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette Securities Corp. The Darman announcement came on the eve of the semi-annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, where many policies Darman helped shape will be debated. He helped Baker devise the September, 1985 Plaza Agreement, when the United States, Japan, West Germany, France and Britain curbed the dollar\\'s strength. The pact was a major turning point in U.S. Policy, ending a period of disdain for economic cooperation and intervention in currency markets. Darman also worked on some other Baker initiatives, like the Tokyo Summit agreement to intensify coordination of economic policies among the leading industrial countries and the recent Paris Agreement to stabilise currencies and stimulate global growth. These policies are collectively aimed at redressing the huge gap between Japan and West Germany\\'s trade surpluses and the United State\\'s massive trade deficit. That policy goal still remains a prime objective of the Reagan Administration and will not change with Darman\\'s departure. U.K. MONEY MARKET DEFICIT FURTHER REVISED UPWARD The Bank of England said it has revised its estimate of today\\'s shortfall to 800 mln stg from 750 mln, before taking account of 170 mln stg morning assistance. EC MINISTERS WILL DISCUSS STRENGTHENING EMS FLOAT European Community finance ministers and central bankers meet in Belgium this weekend to discuss strengthening Europe\\'s joint currency float amid continuing worries about turbulence on foreign exchanges. Belgian Finance Minister Mark Eyskens, who will host the informal talks, told Reuters the ministers and central bank chiefs would discuss the situation on currency markets in the light of the February agreement among leading industrialised countries to stabilise exchange rates around present levels. In an interview, Eyskens said he felt the Paris accord between the United States, Japan, West Germany, France, Britain and Canada had proved itself \"more or less workable.\" But doubts over its effectiveness and durability have been growing since fears of a trade war between the United States and Japan over computer microchips pushed the dollar to a record low against the surging yen early this week. The talks, at the Belgian resort of Knokke, are being held to coordinate the EC\\'s positions on monetary issues and Third World debt ahead of the Spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank in Washington next week. The EC gathering begins tonight with a dinner but the main discussions will take place tomorrow. Continued international currency turbulence could undermine plans for reinforcing the European Monetary System, the joint float holding eight EC currencies within narrow fluctuation bands, which will feature high on the weekend agenda. Eyskens has repeatedly said that Europe needs a period of calm on world currency markets, and in particular a more stable dollar, before it can set about strengthening the EMS to make it more resilient against exchange rate swings. The EMS has been taking a battering over the last year as the falling dollar has sent funds surging into the dominant EMS currency, the West German mark, forcing ministers to undertake two major realignments of parities within nine months. In the interview, Eyskens made clear he was hoping for a wide-ranging discussion on the future of the eight-year-old EMS on the basis of proposals for bolstering it drawn up by the EC\\'s Monetary Committee and the Committee of Central Bank Governors. The committees were asked to come up with the proposals after the last reshuffle of EMS exchange rates in January. Eyskens repeated calls for the European Currency Unit, the fledgling EC currency at the core of the system, to take over the mark\\'s dominant role in the EMS - a proposal that has met with a cool response in West Germany. He said EC Commission President Jacques Delors would report to the meeting on problems raised by plans to liberalise capital movements fully within the 12-nation bloc by 1992, such as the need for harmonising taxes and banking controls. Eyskens said liberalisation of capital movements without strengthening the EMS would be an element of destabilisation in the Community. He said the crucial issue in the debate was whether member states were willing to push further towards the EC\\'s goal of monetary integration on the basis of an EMS that included management of exchange rates by some kind of common institution, instead of by national central banks as at present. Plans for the creation of such an institution, foreseen by the EMS\\'s founding fathers, have been thwarted by the reluctance of some countries, notably West Germany, to gove up their sovereignty in the monetary field. EMS development has also been held up by Britain\\'s refusal so far to join the system\\'s core exchange rate mechanism. U.K. MONEY MARKET GETS 347 MLN STG AFTERNOON HELP The Bank of England said it has operated in the money market this afternoon, buying back bills totalling 347 mln stg. This brings the total help so far today to 517 mln stg and compares with the Bank\\'s revised estimate of an 800 mln stg shortfall. The central bank purchased in band one 20 mln stg at 9-7/8 pct, in band two 254 mln at 9-13/16 pct, in band three 66 mln at 9-3/4 pct and in band four seven mln stg at 9-11/16 pct. U.K. MONEY MARKET RECEIVES 205 MLN STG LATE HELP The Bank of England said it has provided around 205 mln stg late assistance to the market, bringing the total help today to 722 mln which compares with the Bank\\'s revised deficit forecast of 800 mln stg. STOLTENBERG SAYS PARIS ACCORD POLICY TO CONTINUE West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said the currency agreement reached in Paris in February had been successful and would be continued. Stoltenberg told journalists before he attends next week\\'s International Monetary Fund meeting in Washington that: \"The ... Strategy to stabilise currencies around current levels has proven its worth and will also determine future developments.\" Stoltenberg declined to comment specifically on what he would consider to be an undervalued dollar but said a dollar around 1.80 marks created problems for West Germany\\'s exports. He said studies by international organisations had made it clear that especially in the U.S. And in Japan major efforts remained necessary to support adjustments in foreign trade balances via necessary corrections to economic policy. \"No-one would benefit if, after years of over-valuation, the U.S. Dollar fell into the other extreme, that is, strong under-valuation,\" he said. Stoltenberg said West Germany had a keen interest in a swift agreement between the U.S. And Japan concerning the current trade dispute over semi-conductors. Asked whether he believed the markets would test the Paris currency accord, Stoltenberg did not comment specifically but noted that much of what had been discussed in Paris had not been published. The Paris declaration did not state the levels at which central banks of the major industrialised countries would intervene. Stoltenberg said that everything had been carefully considered. He said he had nothing further to add. TURKISH CENTRAL BANK SETS LIRA/DOLLAR, DM RATES Turkey\\'s Central Bank set a lira/dollar rate for April 6 of 781.95/785.86 to the dollar, up from 782.50/786.41. It set a lira/D-mark rate of 430.15/432.30 to the mark, down from 428.30/430.44. FED EXPECTED TO TAKE NO MONEY MARKET ACTION The Federal Reserve is expected to take no reserve-management action in the U.S. Government securities market during its usual intervention period, economists said. They said that, if the Fed does act, it will likely add temporary reserves indirectly by arranging one to 1.5 billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreements. Federal funds, which averaged 6.14 pct yesterday, opened at 5-15/16 pct and remained there in early trading. Analysts believe this probably is about where the Fed wants the funds rate to be. U.S. JOBS DATA SAID TO RULE OUT FED TIGHTENING A steep drop in goods-producing jobs detracted from U.S. March non-farm payroll employment and makes it unlikely that the Federal Reserve will tighten monetary policy to defend the dollar, economists said. U.S. March non-farm payroll employment rose 164,000, less than the gain of 220,000 to 290,000 the financial markets expected. Manufacturing employment fell 25,000, compared with February\\'s 50,000 gain, while March construction employment dropped 45,000 after being unchanged in February. \"The momentum of industrial activity is tapering off as we end the first quarter,\" said Stephen Roach of Morgan Stanley and Co Inc. \"This sets the stage for more sluggish growth in the second and third quarters.\" \"The Fed will view this as a caution flag on the economy,\" he said. \"They will not ease as long the dollar is weak, but clearly they can\\'t tighten.\" David Wyss of Data Resources Inc said that the downward revision in February non-farm payroll employment to 236,000 from 337,000 means that employment gains in the first quarter were weaker than expected. While Wyss left his first-quarter forecast of real U.S. gross national product growth at 3.5 pct, he said the March jobs data suggested a downward revision in his second-quarter growth forecast to 2.5 pct from 2.8 pct. Bill Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc said the average monthly gain in non-farm jobs in the first quarter was only 237,000, compared with 254,000 in the fourth quarter of 1986. \"There\\'s momentum in first quarter labor force activity, but less than assumed,\" he said. \"Gains in goods-producing jobs were subdued at best. This rules out any possibilty of the Fed tightening for exchange-related purposes.\" In March, the average workweek fell back to its January level of 34.8 hours from 35.0 hours in February. Manufacturing hours also fell back to their January level, totalling 40.9 hours in March compared with 41.2 hours in February. The Commerce Department noted that loss of manufacturing jobs in March was concentrated in automobile, electrical and electronic manufacturing. Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities International said that a 13,000 decline in auto manufacturing employment accounted for nearly half of the total drop in manufacturing jobs. Economists said that a build-up in auto inventories resulting from a steep drop in sales has finally caught up with the labor force and may point to slower growth ahead. Most expect an increase in inventories of as much as five pct to offset a steep four to five pct drop in final sales in the first-quarter GNP accounts. Roach said he expects first quarter U.S. GNP to rise two pct, to be followed by a gain of 1.0-1.5 pct at best in the second and third quarters. He said the March drop in industrial activity \"is a reasonable response in light of the inordinate contribution inventory accumulation made to GNP.\" Economists said the employment data also suggest weak gains in industrial production and personal income for March. They expect only marginal gains, if not small declines, for these indicators, compared with a February increases of 0.5 pct in industrial production and 0.9 pct in personal income. Steve Slifer of Lehman Government Securities said the drop in March construction employment may also signal a drop in March housing starts, which rose 2.6 pct in February to 1.851 million units at an annual rate from 1.804 million units in January. The rate of unemployment fell to 6.6 pct, its lowest level since March 1980, from 6.7 pct in February. But Wyss pointed out that this resulted from a drop in the labor force, which fell to 119.2 mln in March from 119.35 mln in February. \"This just means that there were fewer people looking for work, so the drop in unemployment doesn\\'t mean much,\" he said. He said the latest employment report will not concern the Fed because it does points to GNP growth in the first half of 2.5-3.0 pct, but \"it does suggest they can\\'t afford to tighten to quickly either.\" The statistical factors used to smooth out seasonal fluctuations in the jobs data may have understated March labor force gains, just as seasonal factors probably overstated them in January and February, Slifer said, but are consistent with his forecast of 1.8 pct first quarter GNP growth. Economic growth remains sluggish, but Silfer does not think that the Federal Open Market Committee changed policy at their meeting this week. \"At some point they will be more inclined to ease,\" he said. For the time being, however, the March employment report \"increases the likelihood they won\\'t tighten, regardless of the dollar.\" LAWSON SAYS U.K. ELECTION NOT ONLY EMS BAR British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said the next U.K. Election was not the only element standing in the way of full British membership of the European Monetary System (EMS). But he added that arguments against joining had weakened. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, widely believed to be the strongest government opponent of full EMS membership, has made clear she does not expect to consider joining until after the next UK election, due by mid-1988 at the latest. But Lawson, in answer to a question, told reporters after an informal European Community finance ministers\\' meeting here that other factors apart from the upcoming election stood in the way of full membership. In addition to the question of the exchange rates at which Britain should enter the EMS\\'s core exchange rate mechanism, there was also the impact of sterling membership on the system to be considered, he said. British entry would change the EMS from a monopolar system based on the West German mark to a bipolar mark-sterling system, he noted. \"We have to make sure it would work.\" But Lawson added that some of the considerations that had made it difficult for Britain to join in the past now posed less of a problem. As an example he cited sterling\\'s role as a petrocurrency, which he said was diminishing. \"That argument has clearly weakened,\" he said. Lawson restated that the government was keeping the question of membership under review. EC AGREES ON NEED TO STRENGTHEN EMS European Community (EC) finance ministers and central bankers agreed on the need for greater cooperation to strengthen the European Monetary System (EMS) against international market turbulence, officials said. \"There was a general will to reinforce the European Monetary System, with all that implies,\" Belgian Finance Minister Mark Eyskens said yesterday after hosting a one-day session of informal talks at this Belgian coastal resort. The gathering was the first such discussion since the second major realignment of EMS parities within nine months in January. The system has come under severe strain as funds have flowed out of the slumping dollar and into the dominant EMS currency, the West German mark, sending it soaring against weaker currencies in the system. But Eyskens said February\\'s agreement between leading western industrialised nations to stabilise exchange rates at around current levels was working and this would allow the EC to speed up its efforts to boost the internal stability of the EMS. He told a news conference yesterday\\'s meeting agreed on the need for closer coordination among EMS member governments of interest rate policies and of interest rate differentials between different countries. They also agreed they needed better coordination of exchange market intervention to hold currencies stable, both when they reached their fixed EMS limits and within their agreed margins. But Eyskens said this coordination raised a whole range of technical problems and ministers would discuss these further in Luxembourg in June on the basis of proposals from the EC\\'s Monetary Committee and Committee of Central Bank Governors. He said the EC needed a set of indicators of economic convergence betwen Community countries and it was important that interest rates fulfilled this role together with exchange rates and inflation rates. The Belgian minister, whose country presently holds the presidency of the community, made clear the meeting had not produced any agreement to move radically forward in developing the EMS towards the EC\\'s long term goal of economic and monetary integration. \"We have committed ourselves to reestablishing the normal functioning of the system,\" Eyskens said. Eyskens has repeatedly stressed that he believes the EMS has to be reinforced if the EC\\'s plans to liberalise all movements of capital across national borders by 1992 are to go ahead. EC executive Commission President Jacques Delors told the meeting the authority would put forward proposals for a final phase of capital market liberalisation in October that would include safeguard clauses for member countries for which the move would create difficulties. Eyskens said the ministers and central bankers also discussed the need to \"dedramatise\" realignments of EMS parities by letting high-ranking monetary officials carry them out by telephone rather than calling a meeting of finance ministers. However, West German sources said Bonn Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg was unenthusiastic about the idea. British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson told journalists that one of the technical issues raised by greater coordination of exchange market intervention was the question of which currencies should be used to intervene and held in central bank reserves. He said several EMS member countries believed the EMS would work better if central banks held each other\\'s currencies -- an issue of particular importance regarding West Germany since the Bundesbank holds only dollars in its foreign exchange reserves. He said the debate on dedramatising EMS realignments reflected a general feeling among participants that the way the January reshuffle had been conducted was unsatisfactory. The realignment was marked by acrimony between France and West Germany, with each side blaming the other for strains in the system that forced the parity overhaul. ZAMBIAN CURRENCY FALLS AT FOREIGN EXCHANGE AUCTION The Zambian currency further depreciated yesterday at the second auction since the introduction of a two-tier foreign exchange system last month. The (central) Bank of Zambia said the kwacha was pegged at 16.99 to the dollar, compared to last week\"s rate of 15 to the dollar. The bank, which offered six mln dlrs at the auction, reported demand for 13.4 mln dlrs. At the previous auction, the government offered eight mln dlrs. Last month the government set a fixed exchange rate of nine kwacha per dollar, subject to adjustment against a basket of five currencies, for certain official transactions. It also introduced a new weekly foreign exchange auction only for parastatal organisations and the private sector, where the exchange rate is allowed to float in accordance with market demand. The new auction system is designed to be more restrictive than the previous one, suspended in January after the central bank fell 10 weeks in arrears to successful bidders. Under the new system, no bidder, except the the state oil company Zimoil and the national airline Zambia Airways, is allowed to bid for more than five pct of the foreign exchange on offer. U.S. CREDIT MARKET OUTLOOK - CAUTIOUS TRADING U.S. Bond trading is likely to remain cautious in the near term with a possible downward price bias as market participants focus on trends in the dollar, the economy and Federal Reserve policy, economists said. Most expect the economy to continue showing modest gains, that the dollar has more room to fall and that the Fed will keep policy essentially steady, perhaps for several months. Until trends are clearer, \"the market can only attempt to to establish and hold a new trading range at higher interest rates,\" said economists at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. Merrill Lynch economists Raymond Stone and Ward McCarthy said that while the fundamentals generally bode for a healthy investment climate, the market will have no confidence in this environment until there is illumination of and confidence in U.S. Dollar/trade policy. Salomon Brothers\\' Henry Kaufman said the bond market, highly sensitized to dollar movements, could be encouraged if currency markets seem to be stabilizing or if U.S. And overseas economic growth is perceived as slowing sharply. \"The crucial question, however, is how soon either of these developments is likely to occur,\" Kaufman said. \"Market uncertainties and the erosion of portfolio manager confidence could continue portfolio selling pressure a while longer,\" said Philip Braverman, chief economist at Irving Securities Corp. However, Braverman said that, \"from a longer term perspective, current (bond) prices provide a buying opportunity.\" Despite a nearly one-point bond price rebound Friday on unexpectedly weak March employment data, key 30-year Treasury bonds lost 2-1/4 points in price for the week as a whole and Thursday\\'s 7.93 pct closing yield was a 1987 high. Braverman said historical evidence suggests that a long bond yield in the 7.93 pct area provides a basis for optimism. Bonds closed at 7.86 pct on Friday. The Irving economist noted that three times last year, in a similar \"paroxysm of pessimism,\" the key bonds reached a similar closing yield high. Within three to six weeks in each instance, however, Braverman said bond prices recovered to bring the yield down sharply by 63 to 82 basis points. Mitchell Held of Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co Inc said that many portfolio managers now believe yields could approach nine pct by midyear, which he considers unlikely. Held said that, since late 1986, Smith Barney analysts have spoken about the risk that interest rates could move higher and they continue to believe that an upward bias is likely to persist over the next few months. Held said that in conversations with portfolio managers last week there appeared to be increasing belief that the rate rise had just begun and that yields could approach nine pct by midyear. Naturally, that would mean a sharp bond price fall. \"Yields could rise further over the next few months, but the rise should be less than the 65 basis point rise we\\'ve seen since the start of the year,\" Held said. Most expect Fed policy to be neutral for bonds near term. \"The Fed is currently frozen into a fixed stance,\" said economists at Aubrey G. Lanston and Co Inc. They said the Fed cannot tighten policy and push up interest rates as might be appropriate to stabilize the dollar and head off renewed inflationary psychology. That might harm the fragile U.S. Economic expansion. The Lanston economists said, \"The Fed cannot ease its policy stance to both foster more rapid economic growth and calm domestic and Third World debt jitters without the threat of causing a further decline in the dollar.\" Minutes of February\\'s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting released Friday showed that while the FOMC left policy unchanged it was more inclined to firm rather than ease policy later if conditions in the economy, foreign exchange or credit markets warranted a policy shift. However, economists generally believe that continued fairly sluggish U.S. Economic growth and the financial strains on U.S. Banks resulting from their problem loans to developing countries rule out any Fed policy firming. There is broad agreement among economists that the FOMC at last Tuesday\\'s meeting also left Fed policy unchanged. This week\\'s U.S. Economic data are expected to have little impact. February consumer instalment credit numbers are due on Wednesday, with March producer price data out Friday. There may be mild relief in some quarters that the U.S. Purchasing Managers Composite Index, a closely-watched economic indicator, rose only to 53.9 pct in March from 51.9 pct. A Friday rumor had put the number far higher. The index\\'s first quarter average also was 53.9 pct, translating into real GNP growth of about three pct if continued through 1987. Federal funds traded at 5-15/16 pct late Friday and are expected to open about there today with no Fed action seen. MIYAZAWA SEES BIG NATIONS REAFFIRMING PARIS PACT Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told a parliamentary committee he expects major nations to reafffirm the currency pact they struck in Paris when they meet this week in Washington, political sources said. The Minister also was quoted as saying he expects major nations to take coordinated action to ensure exchange rate stability. Finance Ministry officials were unavailable for immediate comment. In Paris on February 22, six nations - Britain, Canada, France, Japan, the U.S. And West Germany - pledged to cooperate to hold their currencies stable. JAPAN CENTRAL BANK INTERVENES IN TOKYO AFTERNOON The Bank of Japan intervened in early afternoon Tokyo trading to support the dollar against active selling by institutional investors and speculative selling by overseas operators, dealers said. The central bank had also bought dollars against the yen in morning trade. The dollar traded around 145.20/30 yen when trading began in the afternoon here and weakened only slightly, the dealers said. Bundesbank sets 28-day securities repurchase tender at fixed 3.80 pct Bundesbank sets 28-day securities repurchase tender at fixed 3.80 pct BUNDESBANK SETS NEW REPURCHASE TENDER The Bundesbank set a new tender for a 28-day securities repurchase agreement, offering banks liquidity aid at a fixed bid rate of 3.80 pct, a central bank spokesman said. Banks must make their bids by 1400 GMT today. Funds will be allocated by 0900 GMT tomorrow and credited to accounts later in the day. Banks must repurchase securities pledged on May 6. NO INTERVENTION, DOLLAR FIXED AT 1.8218 MARKS The Bundesbank did not intervene as the dollar was fixed lower at 1.8218 marks after 1.8243 yesterday, dealers said. BANK OF JAPAN INTERVENES SHORTLY AFTER TOKYO OPENS The Bank of Japan bought a small amount of dollars at around 145.95 yen shortly after the Tokyo market opened, dealers said. But the dollar then fell on speculative selling by trading houses, they said. The dollar had opened here at 145.95 yen against 145.85/90 yen in New York and 146.00 yen at the close here yesterday. BANK OF JAPAN TO SELL 800 BILLION YEN IN BILLS The Bank of Japan will sell tomorrow a total of 800 billion yen worth of financing bills from its holdings to help absorb a projected money market surplus of 1,300 billion yen, money traders said. Of the total, 400 billion yen will yield 3.8502 pct on sales from money houses to banks and securities houses in a 41-day repurchase accord maturing on May 19. Another 400 billion yen will yield 3.7991 pct in a 20-day repurchase pact maturing on April 28, they said. The repurchase agreement yields compare with the 3.8125 pct one-month, and 3.7500 pct three-week commercial bill discount rates today. Tomorrow\\'s surplus is attributable to government tax allocations to local governments and public entities. The operation will put outstanding bill supply at about 4,300 billion yen, they said. NO INTERVENTION, DOLLAR FIXED AT 1.8218 MARKS The Bundesbank did not intervene as the dollar was fixed lower at 1.8218 marks after 1.8243 yesterday, dealers said. Dealers said dollar trading was very quiet over the European morning, with operators made wary by today\\'s meeting of the Group of Five finance ministers and central bank chiefs ahead of the full IMF/World Bank session in Washington. It was undermined by remarks from U.S. Council of Economic Advisers Chairman Beryl Sprinkel who told Iowa bankers the U.S. Had no objective regarding the value of the dollar. Sprinkel also called the reference to stabilizing exchange rates at about current levels, made at the Paris meeting on February 22, a \"vague statement,\" casting doubt on operators\\' assumptions that a secret target level had been set. Sprinkel added that if West Germany and Japan made progress to stimulate their economies as the Paris agreement envisaged, \"there would not be the necessity of significant declines in the dollar.\" One dealer for a U.S.-based bank noted the dollar tended easier after the remarks. \"They were obviously regarded as being negative. And if the market starts regarding anything that comes out negatively then it means that the underlying sentiment is negative,\" he said. Some early selling pressure softened the dollar\\'s undertone. Most operators overlooked intervention by the Bank of Japan to support the dollar against selling in favour of the yen by institutional investors and overseas operators, dealers said. After the strong focus on the dollar/yen rate in recent weeks up to the end of the Japanese financial year on March 31, interest and activity was likely to switch, dealers said. \"We can start to look at a point in time where the interest shifts away from dollar/yen and more into dollar/mark and the other European currencies,\" the U.S. Bank dealer said. Despite the softer undertone, traders would remain wary of taking significant new positions during the Washington meetings, dealers said. Aside from the G-5 session today, Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl is due to meet the German Affairs group on international monetary issues later. The mark gained some strength from news the Bundesbank set a new securities repurchase tender to add money market liquidity at a fixed 3.80 pct, unchanged from those over the last several weeks. Some expectation had been growing that it might cut the rate or move to a minimum interest rate tender, signalling a desire for a slight easing in credit policy. Bundesbank central bank council member Lothar Mueller said the Bundesbank had not given up its focus on money supply. A monetary policy which took into account exchange rates and capital flows could not be confused with an exchange-rate oriented policy, he said, contradicting some growing sentiment. Sterling eased a touch to 2.950 marks at the fixing from 2.957. The yen\\'s unabated strength, despite the intervention, brought it up to 1.2555 marks per 100 from yesterday\\'s 1.2480. The Swiss franc rose to a fix of 120.515 marks per 100 from 120.180. The French franc eased to 30.055 marks per 100 after 30.060, Belgian franc was little changed at 4.829 marks per 100. JAPAN CENTRAL BANK INTERVENES IN TOKYO AFTERNOON The Bank of Japan intervened in early afternoon Tokyo trading to support the dollar against active selling by institutional investors and speculative selling by overseas operators, dealers said. The central bank had also bought dollars against the yen in morning trade. The dollar traded around 145.20/30 yen when trading began in the afternoon here and weakened only slightly, the dealers said. U.K. MONEY MARKET GIVEN 224 MLN STG ASSISTANCE The Bank of England said it had provided the money market with 224 mln stg help in the morning session. This compares with the Bank\\'s forecast of a shortage in the system today of around 850 mln stg which it earlier revised up from 800 mln. The central bank bought bank bills comprising 27 mln stg in band one at 9-7/8 pct, 21 mln stg in band two at 9-13/16 pct and 171 mln stg in band three at 9-3/4 pct. It also purchased three mln stg of treasury bills and two mln stg of local authority bills in band three at 9-3/4 pct. EGYPTIAN CENTRAL BANK DOLLAR RATE UNCHANGED Egypt\\'s Central Bak left the dollar rate for Commercial banks for April 8 unchanged at 1.353/67 pounds. U.K. MONEY MARKET GIVEN FURTHER 284 MLN STG HELP The Bank of England said it provided the money market with a further 284 mln stg assistance in the afternoon session. This takes the bank\\'s total help so far today to 508 mln stg and compares with its revised estimate of a 900 mln stg shortage in the system which it earlier revised up from 850 mln. The central bank made outright purchases of bank bills comprising 100 mln stg in band one at 9-7/8 pct, 56 mln stg in band two at 9-13/16 pct, 112 mln stg in band three at 9-3/4 pct and 16 mln stg in band four at 9-11/16 pct. VOLCKER SAYS FURTHER SIZEABLE DECLINE IN DOLLAR COULD BE COUNTERPRODUCTIVE VOLCKER SAYS FURTHER SIZEABLE DECLINE IN DOLLAR COULD BE COUNTERPRODUCTIVE RUDING AGAINST FURTHER DOLLAR FALL, TRADE CURBS Shifts in domestic economic policy, not a further fall in the dollar or trade restrictions, are the key to reducing imbalances in trade and payments, Dutch Finance Miniister H. Onno Ruding said. Ruding told a meeting of the World Trade Forum here that protectionism would naturally lead to retaliation and aggravate the problems of heavily indebted developing countries. \"The main contribution towards resolving the still enourmous U.S. trade deficit is not repeat not a further fall in the dollar, is not still more protectionism in your country.\" \"No, it is - like in other countries - changes in domestic economic and financial policies,\" Ruding said. Ruding said he was less worried about a crisis of the weakening dollar than he was in January before the Paris accord to stabilize foreign exchange rates. He said the highest priority should be given to policy changes in the United States, especially reducing the budget deficit and encouraging domestic savings. But he said other countries, such as Japan and West Germany, also needed to take greater steps toward reducing their trade surpluses. VOLCKER WARNS AGAINST SIZEABLE DLR DECLINE Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker said a further large drop in the value of the dollar could be counterproductive for world economic growth. Testifying before the Senate Banking Committee, Volcker said that Europe and Japan were slowing exports and that growth in those countries was also decreasing. \"In that kind of situation, further sizeable depreciation of the dollar could well be counterproductive,\" he said. Domestic expansion in foreign industrial countries has not been enough to offset the effects of slower exports, Volcker said. On the value of the dollar, Volcker said he could not say whether it should be higher or lower to restore balance in trade. \"What we do know is that a substantial exchange rate adjustment has already been made,\" he said. \"That adjustment should be large enough, in a context of a growing world economy and fiscal restraint in the United States, to support the widespread expectations of a narrowing in the real trade deficit in the period ahead,\" he said. Volcker said U.S. exports were now growing substantially while import growth should slow. Volcker said that to improve the trade deficit with a minimum of inflationary pressure, the United States would have to slow its spending growth. It would also have to achieve a better balance between investment and domestic savings if it wants to be able to dispense with foreign capital. \"The constructive way to work in the needed direction would be to reduce our budget deficit, year by year, paving the way for improvements in our trade accounts,\" he said. Relying on depreciation of the dollar alone would risk renewed inflation, he said. TURKISH CENTRAL BANK SETS LIRA/DOLLAR, DM RATES The Turkish Central Bank set a Lira/Dollar rate for April 8 of 784.50/788.42 to the Dollar, down from the previous 784.35/788.27. The Bank also set a Lira/Mark rate of 430.60/432.75 to the Mark, down from the previous 429.35/431.50. BUNDESBANK RETAINS MONEY SUPPLY POLICY Bundesbank council member Lothar Mueller said the bank has not given up its money supply policy and that restraining money supply growth does not always mean pushing up interest rates. Mueller said in an article for the Boersen Zeitung financial daily that a monetary policy which took into account exchange rate expectations and capital flows could not be confused with an exchange rate oriented policy. The article followed international press speculation that the Bundesbank had abandoned money supply targetting in favour of an exchange rate policy. Mueller, a member of the Bundesbank council in his position as president of the regional state central bank in Bavaria, noted that the Bundesbank\\'s decision in January to cut leading interest rates amid continuing strong monetary growth had led some people to think it was dropping monetary targetting. \"Simply to ignore the external economic context would be risky and dangerous for monetary policy,\" he explained. Mueller said the cuts in official interest rates had put an end to interest rate speculation. The Bundesbank could now assume that upward pressure on the mark would ease and currency inflows slow down. Lower money market rates, achieved by widening short and long term interest rate differentials, also encouraged investors to re-invest funds parked in liquid accounts, Mueller said. The measures therefore aimed clearly at bringing monetary growth back onto the desired path, he said. \"Finally, of course, and there is no need to keep this quiet, the cut in interest rates was also in line with the changed economic situation of the last few months,\" he added. \"All in all, the Bundesbank in no way abandoned its money supply policy with the January discount rate cut, despite suppositions to the contrary,\" Mueller said. \"Keeping money supply developments in check is not always synonymous with raising interest rates, especially when excessive liquidity due to inflows from abroad, rather than growth in bank credits, is the cause of rising monetary holdings of non-banks,\" Mueller said. Now that West Germany no longer ran large external deficits other concepts were needed for monetary policy. Mueller said it would be both difficult and dangerous for monetary policy to pursue a specific mark/dollar exchange rate. In any case, the exchange rate partly depends on U.S. Currency and budgetary policy and the U.S. Economy, he said. But an exchange rate orientation would also mean the end of a strict stability policy because both interest rates and liquidity would be affected by required currency intervention and could no longer be steered autonomously by the Bundesbank. Even interest rates are not in the centre of the Bundesbank\\'s considerations, but reflect competition and other market conditions, Mueller said. A cut in bank liquidity will not directly influence central bank money stock, the Bundesbank\\'s main money supply indicator. This does not reflect banking liquidity, but the liquidity of industry and households which cannot be directly reached with the Bundesbank\\'s instruments, Mueller said. The less dependent non-banks are on bank credits, the harder it is to steer money supply. This has increasingly been the case recently, because non-banks have received considerable sums from current account surpluses and capital imports. \"If the Bundesbank had tried to brake the money supply rise with higher interest rates, as would have been appropriate if credit was growing excessively, it would not only have missed its target but probably even set off further inflows,\" he said. Mueller said growth in money supply was still too high. In the last three months money stock grew at an annual rate of seven pct, down from 10 pct in the previous quarter. The growth curve has therefore come closer to the three to six pct 1987 target corridor for central bank money stock growth, pointing to the success of the current policy, he said. But high monetary stocks can be a warning sign and there should be no change in priorities. \"Monetary policy must be first and foremost stability policy and successful stability policy is money supply policy -- nothing else,\" he said. VOLCKER URGES GREATER EXCHANGE RATE STABILITY Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker said international policymakers should make improving the stability of exchange rates a major priority. In testimony before a Senate Banking subcommittee, Volcker said he does not have any specific proposals for improving exchange rate stability, but thought it was worthy goal. \"I do think we ought to be thinking about and working toward greater exchange rate stability,\" Volcker said. \"I think that the objective of greater exchange rate stability ought to loom larger among our various policy priorities.\" ITALY SAYS G-7 GIVES CHANCE TO VERIFY TOKYO ACCORD This week\\'s Group of Seven (G-7) meeting in Washington provides an opportunity to verify an accord reached at the Tokyo summit last May to include Italy and Canada in Group of Five (G-5) talks on management of the international monetary system and related issues, the Italian Treasury said. It said in a statement the G-7 meeting, which Italy plans to attend, will provide a forum for considering the Tokyo accord in the light of events in Paris in February this year. On February 22, Italy boycotted a meeting in Paris of its G-7 partners - the United States, Japan, West Germany, France, Britain and Canada - after being excluded from an earlier session of talks involving G-5 members. Today\\'s statement from the Italian Treasury said- \"Nobody denies the existence of G-5 but we should like it to be remembered that the Tokyo accords provided for the enlargement of the group to Italy and Canada whenever \"the management or the improvement of the international monetary economic policy measures are to be discussed or dealt with.\\'\" Italy refused to attend the Paris G-7 meeting on the grounds that G-5, grouping the United States, Japan, West Germany, France and Britain, had reduced Italy\\'s role to rubber stamping agreements already taken. The Italian Treasury said today that Italy was \"certain that this time incidents would not occur.\" But it said it would be opportune to look in depth at the role and the procedures of G-7 in relation to those of G-5. VOLCKER SEES DOLLAR AS FACTOR IN MONETARY POLICY Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker said the performance of the dollar in exchange markets could be a factor in the U.S. central bank\\'s decisions on monetary policy. \"The performance of the dollar in the exchange market might become a factor bearing on our provision of reserves,\" Volcker said in testimony to the Senate Banking Committee. He said that fiscal policy changes in the United States, Germany and Japan would be more important that intervention to instill confidence in current exchange rate levels. FED EXPECTED TO SET CUSTOMER REPURCHASES The Federal Reserve is expected to intervene in the government securities market to supply temporary reserves indirectly via customer repurchase agreements, economists said. They said the Fed is expected to execute anywhere from 1.5-2.0 billion dlrs of customer repos to offset seasonal pressures on bank reserves. Federal funds, which averaged 6.20 pct yesterday, opened at 6-1/8 pct and remained there in early trading. VOLCKER SAYS RESTRICTIVE MONETARY POLICY WOULD HURT INVESTMENT VOLCKER SAYS RESTRICTIVE MONETARY POLICY WOULD HURT INVESTMENT VOLCKER SEES TIGHT POLICY HURTING INVESTMENT Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker said a restrictive monetary policy would be damaging to investment and that a better course would be to restrain spending. \"A restrictive monetary policy would hit investment. You don\\'t want to put interest rates up unless you have to,\" Volcker told the Senate Banking Committee. \"That is not a constructive way to proceed,\" he said. Volcker said that given a choice between squeezing the budget deficit or squeezing investment, he would favor squeezing the budget deficit. In response to a question about banks, Volcker said he would be pleased if Congress decided to give banks a tax writeoff as an incentive for them to take greater reserves against loans to debtor countries. \"If you give a tax writeoff for reserving against loans, then we will see more reserving and that would make me happy,\" Volcker told Committee Chairman Sen William Proxmire (D-Wisc). FED SETS TWO-DAY SYSTEM REPURCHASES, FED SAYS FED SETS TWO-DAY SYSTEM REPURCHASES, FED SAYS FED SETS TWO-DAY SYSTEM REPURCHASES The Federal Reserve entered the government securities market to arrange two-day repurchase agreements for system account, a spokeswoman for the New York Fed said. Fed funds were trading at 6-1/8 pct at the time of the direct injection of temporary reserves, dealers said. Most economists had expected a less aggressive injection of reserves via customer repurchase agreements. DUTCH MONEY MARKET DEBT RISES IN WEEK Loans and advances from the Dutch Central Bank to the commercial banks rose by 1.2 billion guilders to 10.7 billion in the week up to and including April 6, the Bank\\'s weekly return showed. Paper discounted with the Bank also rose, by 477 mln guilders to 916 mln. These rises were balanced by a 1.6 billion guilders rise in the Treasury\\'s account at the Bank, made up mainly of repayments on housing loans by local authorities.  The Treasury\\'s account stood at 8.1 billion guilders, the weekly return showed. The Bank\\'s gold and currency reserves rose by 484 mln to 56.89 billion guilders, while the value of non-gold holdings rose by 140 mln guilders, analysts said. They added that the rise in the reserves was merely the result of commercial currency transactions by the Bank. Call money and period tariffs were only fractionally changed this week and were seen sustaining their stable levels since no dramatic changes in the money market debt, currently around 10.25 billion guilders, are expected. Today call money traded between 5-3/8 to 5-1/2 pct and period tariffs all between 5-5/16 to 5-7/16 pct. SWAP DEALERS UNVEIL STANDARD CONTRACT The International Swap Dealers Association has developed the first standard form contract for use by arrangers of currency and interest rate swap transactions, said Thomas Jasper, the Association\\'s co-chairman. The contract, unveiled at a press conference , is expected to make the 300 billion dlr a year swap market more efficient, he said. \"The contracts wil accelerate the process and reduce the expense of swap documentation,\" Japsper said. Privately, eurobond traders estimate that about 80 pct of all new issues eventually become part of either an interest rate or currency swap. An interest rate swap occurs when two issuers, usually acting through a bank middleman, agree to accept each other\\'s interest payments on debt securities. Usually, the issuer of a floating rate debt security swaps into fixed-rate debt and vice versa. But the obligation for repayment of the debt remains with the original borrower. Bank regulators have become concerned about the use of swaps because the middleman, usually a bank, takes on some portion of the risk but is not required to show it on the balance sheet as a liability and may not have sufficient capital to cushion it. Kenneth McCormick, a co-chairman of the ISDA and president of Kleinwort Benson Cross Financing Inc, said the Bank of England and the U.S. Federal Reserve Board were expected later today to announce joint proposals for setting minimum capital standards for counterparties in swaps. The standards are part of the recently announced convergence agreement between the two countries in which regulators have attempted to set similar capital requirements for institutions. McCormick told reporters the ISDA was concerned that a \"level playing field\" be maintained in the swaps market. He said if U.K. And U.S. Banks were required to hold more primary capital against swap transactions than is the current practice, the additional costs would have to be passed on to issuers. The issuers might then choose to do business with lower-cost banks which are not subject to U.S. Or U.K. Banking rules. He said the ISDA had been working on a code of conduct for swap dealers as part of its self-regulatory effort. That code should be completed within the next few weeks, he said. U.K. MONEY MARKET GIVEN 85 MLN STG LATE HELP The Bank of England said it had provided the money market with late assistance of around 85 mln stg. This brings the bank total help so far today to some 87 mln stg and compares with its latest forecast of a 250 mln stg shortage in the system today. 7-APR-1987 16:46:14.77 7-APR-1987 16:46:14.77 7-APR-1987 17:02:48.51 7-APR-1987 17:02:48.51 JAPAN SEEKS TO STRENGTHEN PARIS CURRENCY ACCORD Japan will seek to strengthen the Paris accord on currency stability at the meeting of the group of seven leading industrial nations tomorrow, Japanese officials said. However, the officials travelling with Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and who asked not to be identified, would not provide any details of how they wanted the accord, which was signed by the six leading industrial democracies in February, to be strengthened. Currency target zones, or reference ranges, will not be discussed at the G-7 meeting which is scheduled for tomorrow, the Japanese officials said. The meeting, which is being held in conjunction with this week\\'s International Monetary Fund/World Bank sessions, will reaffirm the currency pact and there is no need for changing the language used in the Paris accord, the officials said. Miyazawa met with U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker early in this afternoon and discussed the dollar/yen exchange rates, officials said, but they declined to disclosed the details of that discussion. The Japanese officials also declined to detail what Miyazawa and Baker discussed on the subject of greater joint intervention in currency markets to stabilize the dollar or on independent American intervention. The officials said such a money market action to stabilize the dollar is not only for the benefit of Japan, which is suffering from a sharp appreciation in its currency, but also for the benefit of the United States as well. As to U.S. urgings for Japan to take steps to boost its domestic demand to reduce its trade surplus, Japan will explain economic measures to the G-7, the officials said. However, Miyazawa failed to outline the size of the Japanese economic package in his meeting with Baker today because the Japanese 1987/88 budget has not been authorized by the Diet, or parliament, despite the new fiscal year which started April one, the officials said. Japan\\'s ruling liberal democratic party revealed its own economic package today calling for more than 5,000 billion yen in additional spending. CURRENCY FUTURES TO KEY OFF G-5, G-7 MEETINGS News of an agreement among G-5 and G-7 finance ministers meeting in Washington this week will be key to the direction of currency futures at the International Monetary Market, but any such agreement will need to go beyond the Paris accord to stem the recent rise in futures, financial analysts said. \"If they (the finance ministers) give the market something really new to look at -- that is, some package that goes beyond the Paris agreement -- you could have a real boost in the dollar,\" said Shearson Lehman Brothers analyst Anne Mills. On the other hand, \"anything neutral would tend to be bearish for the dollar,\" Mills said. Traders and analysts agree a simple reaffirmation of the Paris accord will not be enough to halt the decline in the dollar, nor will central bank intervention. \"A lot of people are looking for a reason to buy currencies and sell the dollar,\" said one trader for a large retail firm on the floor of the IMM. \"If there is no concrete resolution, they will be looking to sell the dollar, possibly down to the 1.80 mark level,\" he said. Technically, most currency futures are poised for another rise, said Smith Barney Harris Upham analyst Craig Sloane. Sloane noted that June yen futures set a new contract high on Tuesday and closed at its best level ever, while June sterling set a new contract high on Monday. \"Everything seems to be coming to a head right now and you don\\'t need much to get things rolling,\" Sloane said. In particular, the June Canadian dollar, for which Sloane recently put out a buy recommendation, has hovered in a range between 0.7600 and 0.7660 in recent weeks, forming a triangle on the charts from which it may soon break out on the upside. A close above the contract high of 0.7665 would signal a breakout, Sloane said, and would likely mean the nearby Canadian dollar contract would extend its advance to near the 0.7800 level. June Canadian dollar closed at 0.7656 Tuesday. Mills noted, however, that interest rate differentials between Canadian securities and U.S. securities have narrowed dramatically recently, with yields on 10-year Canadian bonds only about 80 basis points above U.S. 10-year notes. What has helped the Canadian currency, she noted, is an increasing proportion of foreign funds flowing into the Canadian equity market, particularly from Japanese investors. Other analysts, however, said currency futures may be near the top of their long-term rally. \"Something will be done at the (G-5 and G-7) meeting to calm people,\" said David Horner of Merrill Lynch Economics. The Paris accord has pretty much fixed where major European currencies will trade, Horner said. But sterling futures may still make another run for new highs, up to 1.6300 to 1.6500 dlr in the June contract, on the positive atmosphere that will prevail before British elections and possibly another interest rate cut, Horner said. The June British pound closed at 1.6080 on Tuesday. Horner said that new boundaries for the trading range of the yen are likely to come out of the G-5 and G-7 meetings. The most likely range will be a bottom for the dollar between 140 to 142 yen per dollar and a top near 150 to 152 yen, Horner said. In yen futures, the bottom of the dollar\\'s range would be equivalent to 0.007100 to 0.007150 in the June contract. June yen closed at 0.006913 on Tuesday. If such a range does emerge from the meetings, \"we will have one more rally in the yen,\" Horner said. POEHL WARNS AGAINST FURTHER DOLLAR FALL Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl said a weaker dollar would be risky and a further appreciation of the mark would damage prospects for sustained West German economic growth. In a speech to the Institute of Contempory German Affairs here, Poehl said \"It would be an extremely risky policy to aim for a further substantial decline in the value of the dollar to correct the trade deficit.\" He said the United States could face a vicious circle of depreciation, inflation and more depreciation if it took that route. Poehl noted West Germany had already taken steps to meet U.S. Demands for greater stimulation of its domestic economy, accelerating tax cuts, cutting interest rates and tolerating above-target money supply growth. He said he would have been happy to have brought forward five billion marks of tax cuts now planned for January 1988 to the beginning of this year, but he said the government faced political constraints getting such measures through the upper house of the West German parliament. But there were also limits to the impact West Germany could accept on exports from a rising mark, he said. Poehl said West Germany relied on exports for about one-third of its gross national product, so a substantial erosion of export markets could not be offset by increasing demand at home. \"A further appreciation of the mark could even be an obstacle to further growth,\" he said. Poehl said the Bundesbank had tolerated rapid money supply growth last year because the country enjoyed low inflation and because external factors, including low oil prices and favourable terms of trade, had given some extra leeway. But Poehl said West Germany now faced a difficult dilemma over monetary policy. The underlying rate of inflation was now two pct, not the reported negative inflation rates last year, and West Germany was affected more than before by exchange rate developments. \"For the time being, we will have to focus our policy more on the external side, and we can live with a more expansionary money supply. But we must be very careful,\" he said. He said he shared some of the U.S. Concern about Japan\\'s trade surpluses, which affected European countries as well as the United States. Poehl welcomed the so-called Louvre accord of monetary officials of major industrialized countries, saying the importance of the February 22 agreement to stabilize exchange rates had been underestimated. All partners had agreed that the dollar was at about the right level, and that further changes would damage growth, he said. \"This was a remarkable change in attitude, especially on the part of our American colleagues,\" he said. But he said there was still a danger that the correction of the dollar\\'s value could overshoot. Bank of Japan buys dollars shortly after opening at around 145.30 yen -- dealers Bank of Japan buys dollars shortly after opening at around 145.30 yen -- dealers BANK OF JAPAN INTERVENES SOON AFTER TOKYO OPENING The Bank of Japan bought a small amount of dollars shortly after the opening at around 145.30 yen, dealers said. The central bank intervened as a medium-sized trading house sold dollars, putting pressure on the U.S. Currency, they said. The dollar was also supported by a major electrical consumer goods company, which was a speculative dollar buyer at around 145.25 yen, they added. The dollar opened at 145.33 yen against 145.60/70 in New York and 145.25 at the close here yesterday. SOUTH KOREAN WON FIXED AT 25-MONTH HIGH THE BANK OF KOREA SAID IT FIXED THE MIDRATE OF THE WON AT 844.30 TO THE DOLLAR, ITS HIGHEST LEVEL SINCE FEBRUARY 26, 1985, WHEN IT WAS 843.90. THE WON WAS SET at 845.50 YESTERDAY. THE WON HAS RISEN 2.03 PCT AGAINST THE DOLLAR SO FAR THIS YEAR, AFTER RISING 3.34 PCT IN 1986. FED EXPECTED TO ADD TEMPORARY RESERVES The Federal Reserve is expected to enter the U.S. Government securities market to add temporary reserves, economists said. They expect it to supply the reserves indirectly by arranging around 1.5 of customer repurchase agreements. Federal funds, which averaged 6.22 pct yesterday, opened at six pct and remained there in early trading. U.S. TREASURY DEPUTY ASST SECRETARY BERGER SAYS FURTHER DOLLAR DROP COULD CAUSE INFLATION U.S. TREASURY DEPUTY ASST SECRETARY BERGER SAYS FURTHER DOLLAR DROP COULD CAUSE INFLATION U.S. TREASURY AIDE WARNS ON INFLATION Thomas Berger, Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Treasury, said that a further drop in the exchange value of the dollar could cause prices to go up and trigger inflation. He told a meeting of the President\\'s Export Council that the Japanese and the Germans have cut their profit margins to reflect recent drops in the dollar, so prices have remained much the same. But he added that if the dollar dropped further there could be inflation in the United States. Berger also said that a further devalued dollar may cause economic depressions in some U.S. trading partners, and that would not be in America\\'s interest because it would close those markets to U.S. goods. FED DRAFTS CURRENCY, RATE SWAP RISK GAUGE The Federal Reserve Board voted unanimously to propose a formula for calculating the risk of interest rate and currency swaps as part of its ongoing effort to come up with a new capital standard for U.S. banks that takes into account the riskiness of a bank\\'s loans and other assets. Fed officials said an identical proposal was being issues today by the Bank of England. The Fed set a 60-day period for public comment on the plan. The proposal adopted today addresses only the credit risks associated with interest rate swaps, forward foreign exchange contracts and similar financial instruments. Previously, the Fed Jan. 8 proposed a series of guidelines for calculating the risk of other off-balance-sheet activities that banks would be required to take into account in calculating the minimum financial cushion they would need to maintain. Both guidelines set five broad categories of risk for loans and other bank assets and assigned to each a level of risk that would establish a bank\\'s minimum capital needs. The additional guidelines proposed today would determine the amount of capital support required for a bank\\'s current exposure for a given asset and the potential future exposure. The current exposure would be measured by the mark-to-market value of the asset, which would reflect the replacement cost. Potential future increases in the replacement cost would be calculated using credit conversion factors based on statistical analyses by the staffs of the Bank of England and U.S. banking regulators. Future exposure would rise over the life of the asset. The Fed staff said the risk gauge attempted to balance conflicting needs for precision and simplicity. They ignore, for example, the relative volatility of the particular currencies involved in exchange rate contracts. Board officials said the new gauge could increase the capital required of the largest money center banks, which are the principal participants in these types of activities. They cautioned the Fed board to take account of the potential impact of the plan on the ability of U.S. banks to compete in world financial markets. However, the staff concluded, \"The credit risks inherent in such contracts now constitute a significant element of the risk profiles of some banking organizations.\" The Fed proposal would exempt all but the 20-25 largest participants in this market, on grounds the benefits of including the smaller banks would be outweighed by costs. Also excluded would be interest rate and foreign exchange contracts traded on organized exchanges. Governor Martha Seger said she was concerned that Japan was not involved in the U.K.-U.S. effort to draft new capital rules. U.S., BRITAIN AGREE FURTHER BANK CAPITAL PROPOSALS The Bank of England and the U.S. Federal Reserve Board have agreed new proposals for joint standards to measure the risk of an array of credit exposures that do not show up in bank balance sheets, the Bank of England said. The plan, covering swaps, forward contracts and options involving interest or exchange rates, complements proposals agreed in January between the two central banks to make commercial banks in the U.S. And Britain subject to similar standards for measuring capital adequacy, the proposal said. It said no final decisions had been reached yet and banks have until April 16 to comment on the trunk proposals. The Bank of England and Fed said they had faced a dilemma. \"On the one hand (we) are determined to require adequate capital support for potential future exposure -- on the other hand (we) are concerned that overly stringent capital requirements might unnecessarily affect the ability of U.S. And U.K. Banking organisations to price...Contracts competitively.\" At the basis of the new proposals lies the concept of the so-called credit equivalent amount - the current value of a currency or interest rate contract and an estimate of its potential change in value due to currency or interest rate fluctuations until the contract matures. In treatment similar to that agreed in January for balance sheet assets, the credit equivalent will be assigned one of five risk weights between zero and 100 pct, depending on the quality of the counterparty, the remaining maturity of the contract and on collaterals or guarantees to the contract, the plans showed. The proposal showed that collaterals and guarantees would not be recognised in calculating credit equivalent amounts. They would, however, be reflected in the assignment of risk weights. The only guarantees recognised are those given by U.S. And U.K. Governments or, in the U.S., By domestic national government agencies, the proposals showed. The paper said the proposed rules would not cover spot foreign exchange contracts and securities traded in futures and options exchanges. It said U.S. Regulatory authorities and the Bank of England were keen to encourage banks to \"net\" contracts -- consolidate multiple contracts with the same counterparty into one single agreement to create one single payments stream. It recognised that \"such arrangements may in certain circumstances reduce credit risk and wish to encourage their further development and implementation,\" and said some of the current proposals may be changed to take this into account.

NEW BANK RULES TOUGHER THAN NEEDED, DEALERS SAY U.S. and U.K. bank regulators are asking banks to set aside more reserves than is necessary to cushion them against the risks posed by the interest rate and currency swap transactions they carry, swap dealers said. After viewing proposed guidelines released jointly today by the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve Board, dealers said that in effect, regulators are asking them to set aside reserves twice for the same risk. Market participants will have 60 days to respond to the proposals. Adoption of stiffer capital requirements is especially significant in the eurobond markets, which saw new issue volume of about 183 billion dlrs in 1986 according to figures compiled by Euromoney magazine. While no firm figures exist, dealers in eurobonds estimate that 80 pct of all new issues are involved in some swap arrangement. Separately, the ISDA estimates that about 300 billion dlrs worth of swap transactions are outstanding. Kenneth McCormick, co-chairman of the International Swap Dealers Association (ISDA) and President of Kleinwort Benson Cross Financing Inc, said that the Association has no comment and will study the proposals. \"What they are proposing is really double counting,\" Patrick de Saint-Aignan, managing director of swaps for Morgan Stanley and Co, said. Instead, he argues, banks should either be required to hold a percentage of the face value -- say one pct per year to maturity -- or to hold a percentage of the cost of replacing the contract in the event of a counterparty default. \"The potential risk factors are very large relative to what we had expected,\" said a director at one U.K. merchant bank. \"What they are really doing is asking you to capitalize now -- to borrow money now -- to cushion you against risk you might have 10 years from now,\" he added.(Adds title first paragraph). Dealers also said they believe that banks not covered by the agreement, such as those based in Japan, will have a competitive advantage because they will not have to pass the costs on to customers. Indeed, regulators are apparently also concerned about the exclusion of other countries from the new requirements. Federal Reserve Board Governor Martha Seger, following approval of the proposed guidelines by the Fed, said she is concerned that Japan was not involved in the U.K.-U.S. effort to draft new capital rules. Dealers said they were somewhat relieved to see that bank regulators recognized the concept of netting, that is, offsetting the amounts receiveable from and payable to a single counterparty against each other. The paper said that regulatory authorities \"recognize that such arrangements (netting) may in certain circumstances reduce credit risk.\" Furthermore, the paper said, if a netting agreement could be reached that would withstand legal tests, it might be willing to reduce capital requirements accordingly. But dealers said they fear regulators may insist on an airtight netting agreement that is impossible to design. \"One problem is that there has never been a major default in the swaps market. So we don\\'t know if any of the swap arrangements will really stand up in court,\" said one bank official. YEUTTER SEEKS STRONGER TAIWAN, S.KOREA CURRENCIES U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said he hoped the U.S. dollar would continue to decline in relation to the currencies of Taiwan and South Korea as a way to improve the U.S. trade picture. Testifying before the House Appropriations subcommittee which must approve his agency\\'s 1988 budget, he said, \"In my judgment economic factors justify a continued decline.\" Asked by a committee member if he expected a further decline, and how much, Yeutter said the Taiwan and South Korean currencies should be adjusted to reflect \"positive factors\" in their economies. NEW CURRENCY PROBLEM SEEN AMONG U.S, EUROPE, JAPAN The highly visible drama involving the yen\\'s sharp rise against the U.S. Dollar is obscuring the fact that the Japanese currency has hardly budged against major European currencies, thus creating a new set of exchange rate distortions, Japanese and European research officials said. The officials, looking beneath the rhetoric of statements by the Group of Five (G-5) industrial nations, told Reuters the currency movements of the past two years are also creating a fundamentally new world trade picture, which is throwing up new trade tensions and imbalances. Trade figures show that the new currency alignments are already changing the Japan-U.S. Trade axis into a Japan- European Community (EC) axis, to the discomfort of Europe. In many ways, not least in terms of rare international cooperation, the September, 1985 New York Plaza pact between the U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain and France to cut down the value of the dollar was a historic one. But it is the underlying peaks and troughs of the major currency movements which lay bare the real picture, in which the Plaza pact appears as an event of prime importance, but not necessarily central significance, the officials said. The officials said that when the Plaza agreement took place, the dollar was already on its way down. The agreement simply helped it on its way. Senior EC financial expert in Tokyo Tomas de Hora has watched the movements closely. \"You have to look at the dollar\\'s peak compared with now, and that was well before Plaza,\" he said. On February 25, 1985, the dollar peaked against the yen at 263.15 yen. On September 20, the Friday before Plaza, it was 242. Since then, despite massive Bank of Japan intervention and periodic market frights about further G-5 concerted action, the dollar trend has been down, down, down. Yet the ECU is now around 173.4 yen. The historical cross rates for sterling and the mark tell much the same story. The European currencies are moving back up against the yen. The close relationship between exchange rates and trade flows makes it difficult to see which is driving which, but undoubtedly the trade equation between the big three is changing. In 1986, Japanese imports and exports with the EC both grew by around 50 pct in dollar terms, five pct in yen. This gave Japan a 16 billion dlr trade surplus. Last January, Japanese exports to the EC totalled half of of sales to the U.S, against about a third in recent years. Trade with the U.S in 1986 rose 23 pct for exports and 12 pct for imports in dollar terms, but fell 13 pct for exports and 21 pct for imports in yen terms. \"The basic meaning for Europe is that Japanese firms have a tremendous interest in exporting to Europe, where every unit sold maximises profits in yen terms, which is what is important to them. Suddenly, instead of the U.S., It is Europe that is laying the golden egg,\" said de Hora. The EC is worried. EC business also had a remarkable year in Japanese sales, but this can be explained partly due to its start from a small base, compared with total Japan-U.S. Trade. The Japanese think EC firms are now more competitive than U.S. Firms, a factor which is aggravating the exchange rate imbalance, and which will cause problems. \"This currency alignment between Japan and the EC is reflecting the excellent performance of the EC countries. But therefore, Japanese goods may keep their price competitive edge,\" said Azusa Hayashi, Director of the First International Economic Affairs Division of the Foreign Ministry. \"If you want my objective view, I don\\'t expect a drastic improvement in our trade imbalance. Last year, we asked for moderation in exports, and this year we may have to do so again,\" he said. U.K. MONEY MARKET OFFERED EARLY ASSISTANCE The Bank of England said it had invited an early round of bill offers from the discount houses. The Bank forecast the shortage in the system today at around 1.15 billion stg. Among the main factors affecting liquidity, bills maturing in official hands and the take-up of treasury bills will drain some 732 mln stg and exchequer transactions some 245 mln. In addition, bankers\\' balances below target and a rise in note circulation will drain a further 135 mln stg and 30 mln stg respectively. U.K. MONEY MARKET GIVEN 17 MLN STG EARLY HELP The Bank of England said it provided just 17 mln stg assistance to the money market in response to an early round of bill offers. Earlier, the Bank had estimated the shortage in the system today at around 1.15 billion stg. The central bank purchased bills for resale to the market on April 2 at an interest rate of 10-15/16 pct. NIGERIAN CURRENCY FIRMS AT LATEST AUCTION The Nigerian naira firmed 2.6 pct against the dollar after 17 banks were disqualified from bidding at today\\'s weekly foreign exchange auction, the central bank said. The naira finished at 3.8050 to the dollar, against 3.9050 last week. Only 38.39 mln dlrs of the 50 mln dlrs on offer was sold, with all 27 bidding banks successfully obtaining hard currency. The effective rate, including a central bank levy, for transactions in the coming week, was 3.8241 against 3.9246 last week. The failure to sell the whole allocation was due to the central bank\\'s unprecedented disqualification of 17 banks as punishment for inadequate documentation in previous transactions. Banks are required to submit proof that their bids are based on valid commercial transactions and the central bank has complained in the past that many are failing to produce the right paperwork within the specified time. FRENCH INTERVENTION RATE CUT LIKELY, DEALERS SAY The Bank of France is likely to cut its money market intervention rate by up to a quarter point at the start of next week.  This follows a steady decline in the call money rate over the past 10 days and signals from the Finance Ministry that the time is ripe for a fall, dealers said. The call money rate peaked at just above nine pct ahead of the meeting of finance ministers from the Group of Five industrial countries and Canada on February 22, which restored considerable stability to foreign exchanges after several weeks of turbulence. The call money rate dropped to around 8-3/8 pct on February 23, the day after the Paris accord, and then edged steadily down to eight pct on February 27 and 7-3/4 pct on March 3, where it has now stabilised. Dealers said the Bank of France intervened to absorb liquidity to hold the rate at 7-3/4 pct. While call money has dropped by well over a percentage point, the Bank of France\\'s money market intervention rate has remained unchanged since January 2, when it was raised to eight pct from 7-1/4 pct in a bid to stop a franc slide. The seven-day repurchase rate has also been unchanged at 8-3/4 since it was raised by a half-point on January 5. The Bank of France has begun using the seven-day repurchase rate to set an upper indicator for money market rates, while using the intervention rate to set the floor. Sources close to Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said that he would be happy to see an interest rate cut, and dealers said any fall in the intervention rate was most likely to come when the Bank of France buys first category paper next Monday, although an earlier cut could not be excluded. A cut in the seven-day repurchase rate could come as early as tomorrow morning, banking sources said. They said recent high interest rates have encouraged an acceleration in foreign funds returning to France, discouraging the authorities from making a hasty rate cut. But they also pointed out that money supply is broadly back on target, giving scope for a small fall in rates. M-3 money supply, the government\\'s key aggregate, finished 1986 within the government\\'s three to five pct growth target, rising 4.6 pct compared with seven pct in 1985. U.K. MONEY MARKET GIVEN FURTHER SMALL ASSISTANCE The Bank of England said it provided the money market with a further 20 mln stg of assistance during the morning. It again bought bills for resale to the market on April 2 at a rate of 10-15/16 pct. Earlier this morning, it bought 17 mln stg of bills at the same rate and for resale on the same date. The Bank has thus given a total of 37 mln stg so far today, which leaves the bulk of a 1.15 billion stg shortage still in the system. Dealers noted that money market rates again eased this morning and the Bank may have refused bill offers from the discount houses at rates below its established dealing levels. SWISS OFFERS NEW SERIES OF MONEY MARKET PAPER The Swiss Finance Ministry is inviting tenders for a new series of three-month money market certificates to raise about 150 mln Swiss francs, the Swiss National Bank said. Bids would be due on March 10 and payment on March 12. The last issue of three-month paper conducted on February 12 yielded 2.969 pct. EGYPTIAN CENTRAL BANK DOLLAR RATE UNCHANGED Egypt\\'s Central Bank today set the dollar rate for commercial banks for March 6 at 1.373/87 dollars, unchanged from the previous rate. U.K. MONEY MARKET GIVEN HELP, OFFERED FACILITIES The Bank of England said it had given the money market 206 mln stg of assistance this afternoon and offered the discount houses borrowing facilities to take out the rest of the 1.10 billion stg shortage, revised down from an initial 1.15 billion estimate. It made no alteration to its established dealing rates, buying 95 mln stg of band one bank bills at 10-7/8 pct and 111 mln of band two bank bills at 10-13/16 pct. This brings the Bank\\'s total assistance so far today to 243 mln stg. YEUTTER PUTS CURRENCY BURDEN ON TAIWAN, KOREA Responsibility for the appreciation of the Taiwan dollar and the South Korean Won lies soley with those countries, said U.S. trade representative Clayton Yeutter Speaking to the Asia Society, Yeutter said that it is in those countries\\' own long-term interest to raise the value of their currencies against the dollar. Yeutter was responding to a question about what the U.S. could do to encourage appreciation of those currencies against the dollar in order to reduce the large U.S. trade deficits with Taiwain and Korea. \"An undervalued currency will help those countries\\' exports in the short term, but in the long run they have to be concerned about how they are perceived in the international business community,\" Yeutter said. For Taiwan, Yeutter said that with its per capita trade surplus with the U.S., much larger than that of Japan\\'s, and with huge foreign exchange reserves, it was difficult to defend the high import tarrifs and other barriers that prevail in that country. He also said that the south Korean Won should begin to move to reflect underlying economic fundamentals, \"otherwise in two or three years\\' time, Korea will be in the same situation that prevails in Taiwan.\" Turning to the U.S. deficit with Japan of more than 50 billion dlrs, Yeutter said that this situation was not sustainable. \"Something must give soon. If not, there is a great threat of U.S. legislative action to counteract that trend,\" Yeutter said. U.S. COMMERCE DEPT\\'S ORTNER SAYS YEN IS 10 OR 15 PCT UNDERVALUED U.S. COMMERCE DEPT\\'S ORTNER SAYS YEN IS 10 OR 15 PCT UNDERVALUED U.S. COMMERCE DEPT\\'S  ORTNER SAYS DOLLAR FAIRLY PRICED AGAINST EUROPEAN CURRENCIES U.S. COMMERCE DEPT\\'S  ORTNER SAYS DOLLAR FAIRLY PRICED AGAINST EUROPEAN CURRENCIES U.S. COMMERCE\\'S ORTNER SAYS YEN UNDERVALUED Commerce Dept. undersecretary of economic affairs Robert Ortner said that he believed the dollar at  current levels was fairly priced against most European currencies. In a wide ranging address sponsored by the Export-Import Bank, Ortner, the bank\\'s senior economist also said he believed that the yen was undervalued and could go up by 10 or 15 pct. \"I do not regard the dollar as undervalued at this point against the yen,\" he said. On the other hand, Ortner said that he thought that \"the yen is still a little bit undervalued,\" and \"could go up another 10 or 15 pct.\" In addition, Ortner, who said he was speaking personally, said he thought that the dollar against most European currencies was \"fairly priced.\" Ortner said his analysis of the various exchange rate values was based on such economic particulars as wage rate differentiations. Ortner said there had been little impact on U.S. trade deficit by the decline of the dollar because at the time of the Plaza Accord, the dollar was extremely overvalued and that the first 15 pct decline had little impact. He said there were indications now that the trade deficit was beginning to level off. Turning to Brazil and Mexico, Ortner made it clear that it would be almost impossible for those countries to earn enough foreign exchange to pay the service on their debts.  He said the best way to deal with this was to use the policies outlined in Treasury Secretary James Baker\\'s debt initiative. AVERAGE YEN CD RATES FALL IN LATEST WEEK Average interest rates on yen certificates of deposit, CD, fell to 4.27 pct in the week ended February 25 from 4.32 pct the previous week, the Bank of Japan said. New rates (previous in brackets), were - Average CD rates all banks 4.27 pct (4.32) Money Market Certificate, MMC, ceiling rates for the week starting from March 2          3.52 pct (3.57) Average CD rates of city, trust and long-term banks Less than 60 days          4.33 pct (4.32) 60-90 days                 4.13 pct (4.37) Average CD rates of city, trust and long-term banks 90-120 days             4.35 pct (4.30) 120-150 days            4.38 pct (4.29) 150-180 days            unquoted (unquoted) 180-270 days            3.67 pct (unquoted) Over 270 days           4.01 pct (unquoted) Average yen bankers\\' acceptance rates of city, trust and long-term banks 30 to less than 60 days unquoted (4.13) 60-90 days              unquoted (unquoted) 90-120 days             unquoted (unquoted) U.S. TREASURY SAYS NO COMMENT ON YEN VALUE A Treasury Department spokesman refused comment on statements by Robert Ortner, undersecretary of economic affairs for the Commerce Department, that the Japanese yen was undervalued. Ortner, senior economist at the Commerce Department, told an Export-Import Bank conference \"the yen is still a little bit undervalued,\" and \"could go up another 10 or 15 pct.\" Asked for reaction, a Treasury spokesman said officials were aware of Ortner\\'s comments but had no intention of making any comment on them. Ortner, who stressed he was expressing personal views, said he thought the U.S. dollar was \"fairly priced\" against most European currencies and added \"I do not regard the dollar as undervalued at this point against the yen,\" he said. But the yen should go up 10 or 15 pct in value, Ortner said, because it is undervalued against the dollar. The United States and major trade allies West Germany, France, Britain, Japan and Canada met recently in Paris to discuss maintaining stability in international currency values. FED\\'S JOHNSON SAYS DOLLAR IS VERY CLOSE TO APPROPRIATE EXCHANGE RATE LEVEL FED\\'S JOHNSON SAYS DOLLAR IS VERY CLOSE TO APPROPRIATE EXCHANGE RATE LEVEL YEUTTER SAYS BUDGET CUT KEY TO BETTER U.S. TRADE A reduction of the U.S. federal budget deficit will be needed to help eliminate the nation\\'s huge trade deficit, U.S. trade representative Clayton Yeutter said. Speaking to the New York Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Yeutter said \"Capital and trade flows are clearly inter-releated now. \"Unless we get the budget deficit down, we will not get the trade deficit down.\" He did not elaborate on his views of the linkages between the two deficits. Private analysts have said that the financing of large U.S. budget deficits requires heavy capital inflows from overseas investors through purchases of U.S. Treasury and, to a lesser extent, other U.S. securities as well. \"We\\'ll make some progress in reducing the 170 billion dlr trade deficit in 1987, but there\\'s still a long way to go,\" Yeutter said. He said the problem must be approached on many fronts and focus most strongly on U.S. and overseas fiscal and monetary policies to foster economic growth, U.S. competitiveness and the establishment of a \"level playing field\" for trade. The U.S. trade representative said the Federal Reserve under Chairman Paul Volcker has done its part to improve the trade situation by getting interest rates down. On the fiscal side, Yeutter said \"the budget deficit is still our biggest problem\" and there has not been enough progress toward reducing that deficit. In the international area, he said that \"our major trading partners could still do more to stimulate domestic growth.\" Commenting on Japan, which is running around a 80 billion dlr trade surplus with the United States, Yeutter said \"Japan is just not doing the job on the import side.\" Yeutter declined to comment on statements relating to the dollar made earlier today by Commerce Dept undersecretary of Economic Affairs Robert Ortner. In a Washington address to an Export-Import Bank sponsored meeting, Ortner said he believed the dollar at current levels was fairly priced against most European currencies, but that the yen is 10 or 15 pct undervalued. \"The market will determine the dollar\\'s proper value in the end,\" Yeutter said. However, he added that, if the U.S. and other nations do not take the necessary steps to cut the U.S. trade deficit, \"the dollar will be the equalizer.\" Yeutter said there is no quick fix to the trade problem and any resort to such tactics as protectionist trade legislation or trade restrictions poses real dangers. He said \"there\\'s relatively little that Congress can do to legislate a solution to the trade problem.\" Protectionist legislation will only provoke retaliation by U.S. trading partners, Yeutter said. \"There is no doubt in my mind about the willingness of our trading partners to retaliate against unfair trade legislation,\" Yeutter said, adding that policy flexibility is essential in solving international trade problems. NEW CURRENCY PROBLEM SEEN AMONG U.S, EUROPE, JAPAN The highly visible drama involving the yen\\'s sharp rise against the U.S. Dollar is obscuring the fact that the Japanese currency has hardly budged against major European currencies, thus creating a new set of exchange rate distortions, Japanese and European research officials said. The officials, looking beneath the rhetoric of statements by the Group of Five (G-5) industrial nations, told Reuters the currency movements of the past two years are also creating a fundamentally new world trade picture, which is throwing up new trade tensions and imbalances. Trade figures show that the new currency alignments are already changing the Japan-U.S. Trade axis into a Japan- European Community (EC) axis, to the discomfort of Europe. In many ways, not least in terms of rare international cooperation, the September, 1985 New York Plaza pact between the U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain and France to cut down the value of the dollar was a historic one. But it is the underlying peaks and troughs of the major currency movements which lay bare the real picture, in which the Plaza pact appears as an event of prime importance, but not necessarily central significance, the officials said. The officials said that when the Plaza agreement took place, the dollar was already on its way down. The agreement simply helped it on its way. Senior EC financial expert in Tokyo Tomas de Hora has watched the movements closely. \"You have to look at the dollar\\'s peak compared with now, and that was well before Plaza,\" he said. On February 25, 1985, the dollar peaked against the yen at 263.15 yen. On September 20, the Friday before Plaza, it was 242. Since then, despite massive Bank of Japan intervention and periodic market frights about further G-5 concerted action, the dollar trend has been down, down, down. Yet the ECU is now around 173.4 yen. The historical cross rates for sterling and the mark tell much the same story. The European currencies are moving back up against the yen. The close relationship between exchange rates and trade flows makes it difficult to see which is driving which, but undoubtedly the trade equation between the big three is changing. In 1986, Japanese imports and exports with the EC both grew by around 50 pct in dollar terms, five pct in yen. This gave Japan a 16 billion dlr trade surplus. Last January, Japanese exports to the EC totalled half of of sales to the U.S, against about a third in recent years. Trade with the U.S in 1986 rose 23 pct for exports and 12 pct for imports in dollar terms, but fell 13 pct for exports and 21 pct for imports in yen terms. \"The basic meaning for Europe is that Japanese firms have a tremendous interest in exporting to Europe, where every unit sold maximises profits in yen terms, which is what is important to them. Suddenly, instead of the U.S., It is Europe that is laying the golden egg,\" said de Hora. The EC is worried. EC business also had a remarkable year in Japanese sales, but this can be explained partly due to its start from a small base, compared with total Japan-U.S. Trade. The Japanese think EC firms are now more competitive than U.S. Firms, a factor which is aggravating the exchange rate imbalance, and which will cause problems. \"This currency alignment between Japan and the EC is reflecting the excellent performance of the EC countries. But therefore, Japanese goods may keep their price competitive edge,\" said Azusa Hayashi, Director of the First International Economic Affairs Division of the Foreign Ministry. \"If you want my objective view, I don\\'t expect a drastic improvement in our trade imbalance. Last year, we asked for moderation in exports, and this year we may have to do so again,\" he said. REUTER... CANADA DLR DRIVEN BY FOREIGN BUYERS - WILSON Finance Minister Michael Wilson said large inflows of capital into Canada, principally into the country\\'s bond market, is a major reason behind the sharp recovery in the Canadian dollar. He said the inflow of funds, mainly from Japan, Europe and the United States, is the result of \"confidence in the direction this country is going in.\" \"That is the reason why the (Canadian) dollar today is higher than 75 cts (U.S.) compared to this time last year (when it was) a little over 69 cts,\" Wilson told the House of Commons daily question period. Figures released this week show foreigners purchased a record 23.1 billion dlrs of Canadian bonds in 1986, more than double the previous year, with Japan investing a record 9.5 billion dlrs in the market. Wilson was responding to opposition party questions about a possible loss of jobs from the rise in Canadian investment abroad. Canadian investment, including the buying of foreign companies, stocks and bonds, rose to 12.53 billion dlrs from 6.19 billion dlrs in 1985. The minister said the flow of funds from abroad would generate many new jobs in Canada. TREASURY SAYS ONLY REAGAN, BAKER SPEAK ON DLR The U.S. Treasury repeated a White House statement that only President Reagan and Treasury Secretary James Baker are authorized to speak on the dollar. A Department spokesman was commenting on remarks by Commerce Department Under-Secretary Robert Ortner that the yen was undervalued 10 or 15 pct against the dollar but European currencies were fairly priced against the U.S. currency. \"As Larry Speakes said on January 14 this year, only two people in this administration are authorized to speak on the dollar and that is the president and the secretary of the treasury,\" the spokesman told Reuters. GULF BOND, STOCK MARKETS LAG BEHIND, GIB SAYS Gulf money markets have grown reasonably well during the past decade, but bond and stock markets remain to a large extent fragmented and lag behind, &lt;Gulf International Bank BSC> (GIB) said. The bank\\'s economist Henry Azzam said in a review of Gulf capital markets that investors have to relinquish traditional investment vehicles such as real estate, foreign currency bank accounts and precious metals. \"Greater financial sophistication is needed coupled with more diversified capital market instruments and a change in the disclosure requirements on company accounts,\" he said. The GIB study reviewed capital markets under three categories -- money markets, stock and bond markets. Azzam said Gulf states had been making greater use of short-term money market instruments and banks in the region had floated various euronotes and underwriting facilities. \"Nevertheless, bond and stock markets remain, to a large extent, fragmented and lagging behind,\" he said. Most debt in the region is still raised by syndicated loans and bank facilities and very few companies had made use of stock or bond issues. Only Kuwait has an official stock exchange, while other Gulf nations have yet to establish exchanges. But with dwindling financial surpluses in the Gulf, governments are actively pursuing ways to develop capital markets and set up domestic stock exchanges, Azzam said. He said recession stemming from sliding oil prices had \"clearly had a negative impact on the development of capital markets in the region.\" In addition, family firms are reluctant to go public, financial awareness among investors is still lacking and investment analysis and corporate reporting standards lack depth. A sharp fall in share prices in the early 1980s prompted investors to hold on to shares hoping for an eventual recovery. Azzam said the absence of proper commercial law in some Gulf countries and authorities\\' apparent reluctance to adopt financial innovations had also hampered capital markets. He called for clearly defined laws governing incorporation of joint stock companies and the flotation of debt instruments. Azzam said capital market instruments should be made available to all citizens and institutions of Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states -- Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Some moves had been taken in this direction, with Bahrain allowing GCC nationals to own up to 25 pct of locally incorporated companies. Azzam said Gulf money markets had received greater depth from the introduction of treasury bill offerings in Bahrain and the expansion of securities repurchase regulations in Saudi Arabia. But he added there is \"no bond market to speak of\" in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman or the UAE, with the last Saudi riyal denominated bond issued in 1978. While Bahrain plans an official stock exchange and trading in Saudi Arabia has picked up, establishment of formal exchanges in Qatar, Oman and the UAE does not appear imminent, Azzam said. ZAMBIA TO RETAIN CURRENCY AUCTION, SAYS KAUNDA Zambia will retain its foreign-exchange auction system despite the suspension of weekly auctions since January 24, President Kenneth Kaunda said. \"We have not run away from the auction. It hasn\\'t been abolished at all,\" he told Reuters in an interview. He said the system would be reintroduced after current talks with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund and, he hoped, would be backed by fresh foreign aid funds. Kaunda dismissed central bank statements the new auction system would be used to allocate foreign exchange to private bidders but not to fix the exchange rate. Kaunda said the auction system had faltered because of the government\\'s shortage of foreign exchange to meet demand. It was suspended when the kwacha\\'s rapid devaluation and strong fluctuations made economic planning almost impossible for the government and the private sector, he said. Weekly foreign-exchange auctions began in October 1985. The kwacha fell from 2.20 to the dollar to about 15 in 16 months. In January 1987 the government was more than two months in arrears in paying foreign currency to successful bidders, and the auction was suspended and replaced with a fixed exchange rate of nine kwacha to the dollar. U.K. MONEY MARKET DEFICIT REVISED TO 550 MLN STG The Bank of England said it had revised its estimate of the shortage in the money market back to its initial forecast of 550 mln stg. At midsession the central bank changed the shortfall to 500 mln and provided assistance worth 96 mln stg through bank bill purchases in bands one and two at established dealing rates. U.K. MONEY MARKET GETS 350 MLN STG AFTERNOON HELP The Bank of England said it provided assistance worth 350 mln stg during the afternoon session which takes total help so far today to 446 mln stg against a shortage estimated at around 550 mln stg. The central bank purchased outright bank bills comprising 120 mln stg in band one at 10-7/8 pct and 227 mln stg in band two at 10-13/16 pct. It also bought treasury bills worth one mln stg in band one and two mln stg in band two at the same rates of interest as bank bills. NEW DUTCH SPECIAL ADVANCES ANNOUNCED AT 5.3 PCT The Dutch central bank announced new eleven-day special advances at an unchanged 5.3 pct to aid money market liquidity, covering the period March 9 to 20. The amount will be set at tender on Monday March 9 between 0800 and 0830 GMT. The new facility will replace the current 4.8 billion guilders of seven-day advances expiring Monday. Money dealers estimated today\\'s money market shortage at 11 to 11.25 billion guilders, barely changed from yesterday. They said call money was still relatively high at 6-1/8 to 6-1/4 pct as a result of the tight set of bids accepted by the Bank for the previous seven-day facility. TREASURY\\'S BAKER SAYS THERE HAS BEEN NO CHANGE IN U.S. POLICY ON DOLLAR TREASURY\\'S BAKER SAYS THERE HAS BEEN NO CHANGE IN U.S. POLICY ON DOLLAR FED NOT EXPECTED TO ACT IN MONEY MARKETS The Federal Reserve is unlikely to operate in the U.S. government securities market during its usual intervention period this morning, economists said. Fed funds opened comfortably at 5-15/16 pct and remained at that level. Yesterday Fed funds averaged 5.99 pct. BAKER DENIES CHANGE IN U.S. POLICY ON DOLLAR Treasury Secretary James Baker said there has been no change in U.S. policy on the value of the dollar. Baker, when asked if the policy was changed in view of comments yesterday by a senior Commerce Department official who said he thought the Japanese yen was undervalued against the dollar by 10 to 15 pct, replied, \"No.\" Yesterday Robert Ortner, Undersecretary of Commerce for Economic Affairs, said he thought the yen was undervalued but said that was his personal view. This remark caused the dollar to drop as it appeared to conflict with a recent agreement in Paris by the United States and five other industrial nations that currency rates were at about the right level to reflect underlying economic conditions. Baker, who spoke earlier to the National Newspaper Association, declined to elaborate on his statement about U.S. policy. FED SETS ONE BILLION DLR CUSTOMER REPURCHASE, FED SAYS FED SETS ONE BILLION DLR CUSTOMER REPURCHASE, FED SAYS FED SETS ONE BILLION DLR CUSTOMER REPO The Federal Reserve entered the government securities market to arrange one billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreements, a spokesman for the New York Fed said. Fed funds were trading at 5-15/16 pct at the time of the indirect injection of temporary reserves, dealers said. FRENCH PRIMARY BOND MARKET SHOWS NEW SPARKLE The French primary bond market is showing signs of renewed effervescence after several weeks of lethargy and the trend is expected to continue if hopes of imminent interest rate cuts are fulfilled, market operators said. The Bank of France is generally expected to give a signal to the market, possibly at the beginning of next week, by announcing a quarter point cut in its intervention rate, which has stood at eight pct since January 2, or in its seven-day repurchase rate, set at 8-3/4 pct since January 5. The central bank\\'s averaged-out day to day call money rate, the reference rate for interbank money market operators, which reached 8-3/4 pct on February 18 has fallen to 7-3/4 pct this week, dealers noted. The Bank of France\\'s \"open market\" policy to regulate the money markets since December has been based on a floor and ceiling of rates within the limits of its intervention and seven day repurchase rates. For the moment the sentiment is of \"wait and see\" on rate cuts, but there are now more optimists than pessimists among market operators, a dealer for a major French bank said. Dealers said there is abundant liquidity on the bond market, noting that this week\\'s monthly Treasury tap issue of 11.87 billion francs had a good reception and was fairly easily absorbed. The Treasury had set an upper limit on the issue of 12 billion francs and was likely to continue to try and sell as much paper as it could over coming months to meet its borrowing needs for this year of around 150 billion, one banker said. Dealers said there was no difficulty in placing liquidity in the primary market at the moment despite competition from the surge in investments on the Paris stock exchange. There has been a flood of large bond issues, but with formulas well adapted to market conditions and investor demand - with warrants or a mix of fixed and floating-rates - which have been snapped up, and with generally broadly negative fees. Dealers pointed to the recent Caisse d\\'Aide a l\\'Equipement des Collectivites Locales (CAECL) 8.90 pct two billion franc bond with warrants exchangeable for floating-rate bonds issued over 13 years and 80 days at 97.04 pct with payment date March 9, which was today quoted at -0.90 to -1.10 pct. Even classic fixed-rate issues, after being neglected since the end of last year, are finding buyers, one banker said. Dealers said that now the question was to see how the terms of imminent operations would be set, with great market interest focussed on the likely three next issues. These will include an expected four to five billion franc issue for Electricite de France, to be followed by a bond of around one billion francs for Auxiliaire du Credit Foncier, a subsidiary of the banking group Credit Foncier de France, and a new issue by tender from the mortgage agency Caisse de Refinancement Hypothecaire. LIFFE FEBRUARY VOLUMES DOWN, BUT EURODOLLARS UP Total futures and options turnover on the London International Financial Futures Exchange (LIFFE) fell slightly during February, although daily average Eurodollar volume set a new record, LIFFE said today. Total futures and options turnover last month was 822,378 contracts, down from January\\'s 881,778, but sharply above the comparative February 1986 figure of 463,146 lots, it said. Eurodollar turnover during February was 140,417 lots, against January\\'s 100,941 and the year ago figure of 81,648. The daily average was a record 7,020 lots, up four pct from the previous record, set in March 1985. February trading encompassed a new daily record of 66,087 contracts on the 19th of the month, exceeding the previous record of 61,398, which had been set on February 6, LIFFE said. FT-SE 100 index futures volume was sharply higher during February, with 22,109 contracts trading, against January\\'s 15,279 and the year-ago level of 8,181. Open interest also set new records last month in Eurodollars at 29,372 contracts, in FT-SE 100 at 4,898 and in short sterling interest rate futures at 19,846 lots. Key futures volumes as detailed by LIFFE were: Feb\\'87   Jan\\'87    Feb\\'86 Long gilt      424,865  525,354   134,420 Eurodollar     140,417  100,941    81,648 Short sterling  94,720   87,619    67,640 T-bond          84,694   87,980   133,766 FT-SE           22,109   15,279     8,181 Currencies       2,799    2,112     7,737 Short gilt          74       85     6,516 Key options volumes as detailed by LIFFE were: Feb\\'87    Jan\\'87     Feb\\'86 Long gilt     44,640    54,329     ---- Eurodollar     3,580     1,720     2,844 T-bond         1,737     3,479     ---- Sterling       1,466     2,223    18,191 FT-SE          1,277       657     ---- Total options 52,700    62,408    23,238 (Long gilt, T-bond and FT-SE index options were not trading in February 1986). NEW DUTCH ADVANCES TOTAL 4.8 BILLION GUILDERS The Dutch Central Bank said it has accepted bids totalling 4.8 billion guilders at tender for new seven-day special advances at 5.3 pct covering the period March 2 to 9 aimed at relieving money market tightness. Subscriptions to 300 mln guilders were met in full, amounts above 300 mln at 50 pct. The new facility replaces old five-day advances worth 8.0 billion guilders at the same rate. Dealers expect this week\\'s money market shortage to be around 12 billion guilders. YIELD FALLS ON 30-DAY SAMA DEPOSITS The yield on 30-day bankers security deposit accounts issued this week by the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency (SAMA) fell to 5.84073 pct from 6.21950 last Saturday, bankers said. SAMA increased the offer price on the 900 mln riyal issue to 99.51563 from 99.48438. One-month interbank riyal deposits were quoted today at 6-1/4, six pct. SAMA offers a total of 1.9 billion riyals each week in 30, 91 and 180-day paper to banks in the Kingdom. ASIAN DOLLAR ASSETS EXCEED 200 BILLION DLRS The Asian dollar market continued to expand in December with total assets and liabilities rising to 200.60 billion U.S. Dlrs from 188.54 billion in November and 155.37 billion in December 1985, the Monetary Authority of Singapore said. It said the increase came mainly from interbank activity, with interbank lending rising to 146.61 billion dlrs in December from 134.76 billion in November and 104.93 billion in December 1985. Interbank deposits increased to 158.52 billion dlrs against 147.95 billion and 120.03 billion, respectively. Loans to non-bank customers increased in December to 38.74 billion dlrs from 38.64 billion in November and 37.44 billion in December 1985. Deposits by non-bank customers rose to 33.81 billion dlrs against 33.60 billion and 28.02 billion. NEW DUTCH ADVANCES TOTAL 6.5 BILLION GUILDERS The Dutch central bank said it has accepted bids totalling 6.5 billion guilders at tender for new eleven-day special advances at 5.3 pct covering the period March 9 to 20 aimed at relieving money market tightness. Subscriptions to 500 mln guilders were met in full, amounts above 500 mln at 35 pct. The new facility replaces old seven-day advances worth 4.8 billion guilders at the same rate. U.K. MONEY MARKET SHORTAGE FORECAST AT 250 MLN STG The Bank of England said it forecast a shortage of around 250 mln stg in the money market today. Among the factors affecting liquidity, it said bills maturing in official hands and the treasury bill take-up would drain around 1.02 billion stg while below target bankers\\' balances would take out a further 140 mln. Against this, a fall in the note circulation would add 345 mln stg and the net effect of exchequer transactions would be an inflow of some 545 mln stg, the Bank added. BANK OF FRANCE SETS MONEY MARKET TENDER The Bank of France said it invited offers of first category paper today for a money market intervention tender. Money market dealers said conditions seemed right for the Bank to cut its intervention rate at the tender by a quarter percentage point to 7-3/4 pct from eight, reflecting an easing in call money rate last week, and the French franc\\'s steadiness on foreign exchange markets since the February 22 currency stabilisation accord here by the Group of Five and Canada. Intervention rate was last raised to eight pct from 7-1/4 on January 2. Call money today was quoted at 7-11/16 7-3/4 pct. POEHL SAYS FURTHER RATE CUT POSSIBLE - SOURCES Bundesbank president Karl Otto Poehl told a closed investment symposium that West Germany could cut leading interest rates again if the United States makes a similar move, banking sources said. The sources were reporting Poehl\\'s remarks at a symposium in Duesseldorf last week organised by Deutsche Bank Ag. Press representatives were not invited. The sources, speaking separately, said Poehl told about 200 bankers in reply to questions that a cut in U.S. Interest rates would give room for a matching measure in Germany. \"It was a definite hint at lower German interest rates,\" said one banker who attended the symposium. A Bundesbank spokesman said the central bank would have no comment on the reported remarks, made at the private meeting. But, according to a second source, who also declined to be identified, Poehl\\'s comments were seen by bankers present as a direct pointer to further moves by the central bank to defend German industry from an additional revaluation of the mark. \"He said if the Americans drop their interest rates then the Bundesbank would also drop them. He said that quite clearly,\" the second source said. In reply to questions, Poehl also said the half-point cut in the discount and Lombard rates on January 22 came after the U.S. Had signalled it would be prepared to attend a meeting to discuss the level of the dollar on condition Germany made such a move in advance, the sources said. Asked if American authorities could have been persuaded, by cuts in German rates, to come to the bargaining table as early as last September, one of the sources quoted Poehl as saying, \"No, they wouldn\\'t have been. We checked that.\" The Paris meeting of the Group of Six industrial nations took place exactly one month after the German cut in rates. Poehl emphasised in his comments the very close talks between central banks before and after the G-6 meeting, saying that financial markets had not fully realised the significance of the Paris session and the U.S. Agreement to stem further falls in the value of the dollar, the sources said. For the first time all participants at the summit agreed that a further fall in the dollar would be harmful for all world economies, including the U.S., Poehl had said. The sources said the tone of Poehl\\'s comments boosted growing sentiment that the dollar would be stabilised around current levels by international central bank cooperation. One source said Poehl\\'s remarks also underlined the fact that the Bundesbank was now more prepared to be accommodative in monetary policy in order to prevent a further slowdown in West Germany\\'s economic growth. Poehl and other Bundesbank officials have in the past stressed that the German central bank had no direct responsibility for growth and was solely concerned with combatting inflation. This led, for instance, to the introduction of a tighter monetary stance from the beginning of December until the half-point cut in rates in late January. The sources quoted Poehl as saying that the current overshooting of the German monetary target would not directly respark inflation. The Bundesbank was not obliged to react immediately whenever such overshooting occurs. Latest data for central bank money stock, the Bundesbank\\'s main measure of money supply, showed the measure was growing at 7-1/2 pct in January, outside its three to six pct 1987 target. Share prices rose in very active trading today, with dealers reporting that Poehl\\'s remarks, coupled with a bullish outlook on stock prices from Deutsche at the same symposium, brought in strong bargain hunting at current low levels. BONN SERIOUS ABOUT CURRENCY PACT, SAYS TIETMEYER West Germany takes \"very seriously\" the recent undertaking by major industrial countries to promote exchange rate stability around current levels, Finance Ministry State Secretary Hans Tietmeyer said. Talking to journalists before a meeting of European Community Economy and Finance Ministers here, Tietmeyer declined to say whether the February 22 Paris accord by the Group of Five countries plus Canada included secret agreements for stabilising currencies. But he noted the official communique said the participants agreed to cooperate closely to foster stability of exchange rates around current levels. \"We\\'re taking this sentence very seriously,\" he said. Tietmeyer remarked that the dollar had hardly moved against the mark since the meeting. He said a slowdown in West German economic growth had been caused by sharp exchange rate swings and that the Paris agreement should help in this respect. Economics Ministry State Secretary Otto Schlecht said the Bonn government saw no current need for measures to bolster the economy but was paying close attention to the slower growth and had not ruled out \"appropriate and timely\" action if necessary. Schlecht and Tietmeyer were speaking ahead of a discussion by the EC ministers of the latest EC Commission report on the economic situation in the 12-nation bloc. The Commission has sharply revised down expected German gross national product growth this year to two pct from 3.2 pct predicted last autumn and says Bonn has the most room of any EC country to stimulate economic activity. Schlecht said the upturn in West Germany\\'s economy slowed in the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of 1987. But he said there was no cumulative downwards trend in view that would make quick remedial action necessary. He said a number of favourable indicators such as high level of investment and a good climate for consumption meant a recovery could be expected, while exports would pick up slightly during the course of the year. U.K. MONEY MARKET GIVEN FURTHER HELP AT NEW RATES The Bank of England said it provided the market with further assistance during the afternoon, buying bills worth 166 mln stg at the lower rates introduced this morning. It bought 45 mln stg of local authority bills plus 27 mln stg of bank bills in band one at 10-3/8 pct together with 94 mln stg of band two bank bills at 10-5/16 pct. The bank also revised its estimate of the market shortage up to 300 mln stg from 250 mln this morning. It has given total assistance of 213 mln stg today. Bank of France said it cut money market intervention rate to 7-3/4 pct from eight pct Bank of France said it cut money market intervention rate to 7-3/4 pct from eight pct OECD TRADE, GROWTH SEEN SLOWING IN 1987 The 24 nations of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), hampered by sluggish industrial output and trade, face slower economic growth, and their joint balance of payments will swing into deficit in 1987, the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU ) said. The EIU said in its World Trade Forecast it revised OECD economic growth downwards to 2.5 pct this year, compared with a 2.8 pct growth forecast in December. It said the new areas of weakness are West Germany and the smaller European countries it influences, and Japan, hardest hit by currency appreciation this year. The independent research organisation cut its 1987 growth rate forecasts for West Germany to 2.2 pct from 3.2 pct in December and to 2.3 pct from three pct for Japan. It said it expected the OECD to post a current account deficit of some 13 billion dlrs in both 1987 and 1988, due in large part to a 1.50 dlrs a barrel rise in 1987 oil prices. It said the U.S. Current account deficit looked likely to fall even more slowly than forecast, to 125 billion dlrs in 1987 and 115 billion in 1988 from 130 billion in 1986. It said it expected West Germany to post a 31 billion dlr payments surplus and Japan a 76 billion dlr surplus this year. The EIU said it saw oil prices dropping to around 16.50 dlrs a barrel by end-1987 and 15.50 dlrs in 1988 from about 18 dlrs last year, as adherence to OPEC output policy becomes increasingly ragged. It said the dollar is poised to resume its decline in foreign exchange markets, and will lose a further 13 pct on its trade-weighted index this year and five pct in 1988 after last year\\'s 18.4 pct drop. The average mark/dollar rate is put at 1.80 marks this year and 1.70 in 1988 while the yen/dollar rate is expected to break through the 150 yen barrier with an average value of 150 yen in 1987 and 146 yen in 1988, it said. \"This is not a crash scenario but the dollar\\'s steeper angle of descent increases the risk of ending with a fireball rather than a three-point landing,\" the EIU said. \"Talking will not stop the dollar\\'s slide for long and the February meeting (of finance ministers of the Group of Five and Canada) produced scant promise of either a decisive shift to more expansive policies in West Germany and Japan, or a tighter U.S. Fiscal policy,\" it said. It said the key to the dollar\\'s fortunes was the willingness of Japanese institutions to buy U.S. Government assets despite prospects of sustaining a currency loss. \"Thus far they have been willing,\" the EIC said, adding that if Japan was deterred from buying U.S. Bonds the dollar would collapse. To contain such a currency crisis, dollar interest rates would have to soar, bringing recession and a Third World debt crisis, it said. On trade, the EIU said prospects for 1987 look \"increasingly sick.\" Import growth, forecast in December at 4.5 pct, is now seen slowing down to around 3.8 pct in 1987 with a recovery only to 4.2 pct in 1988, it said. The weakness of the West German economy is the biggest single factor, with import growth there expected to feature a sluggish 3.5 pct growth in 1987 against the 6.5 pct forecast in December, the EIU said. On the export side, it said it saw weak demand in West Germany affecting export prospects elsewhere in Europe, while Japan\\'s exports in 1987 would remain flat and sales by U.S. Exporters would respond only marginally to a lower, more competitively-priced dollar. It said in most of Europe and in Japan, raw materials and oil will cost less in domestic currency in 1987 than in 1986. However, rates of inflation will edge up in 1988 to over the current OECD average of three pct. Non-oil commodity prices will show a modest dollar price increase in 1988 for the first time since 1984, the EIU said. After a rise of 18 pct in 1986, the dollar price of internationally traded manufactures will go up by 8.5 pct in 1987 and by five pct in 1988, it said. It said OECD industrial production would rise by only 1.6 pct in 1987 after a weak 1.5 pct increase in 1986. U.K. MONEY MARKET GIVEN LATE HELP WORTH 15 MLN STG The Bank of England said it provided the market with unspecified late assistance worth 15 mln stg. It has given the market total assistance of 228 mln stg today compared with a liquidity shortage it estimated at a revised 300 mln stg. BANK OF FRANCE CUTS INTERVENTION RATE The Bank of France said it cut its money market intervention rate to 7-3/4 pct from eight pct when it injected money against first category paper. The bank also cut its seven-day repossession rate to 8-1/2 pct from 8-3/4 pct. The intervention rate has stood at eight pct since it was raised from 7-1/4 pct on January 2 as the French franc came under pressure ahead of the EMS realignment on January 11. The bank said the purchase, effective tomorrow, is for five pct of private paper and fixed rate Treasury bills maturing between March 25 and June 25 and of other Treasury bills maturing between March 25, 1987 and March 25, 1989. The rate cut had been expected since the bank announced a money market intervention tender earlier today. Money market dealers said conditions seemed right for a quarter percentage point cut, reflecting an easing in the call money rate last week, and the French franc\\'s steadiness on foreign exchange markets since the February 22 currency stabilisation accord here by the Group of Five and Canada. U.K. MONEY MARKET DEFICIT FORECAST AT 800 MLN STG The Bank of England said it forecast a shortage of around 800 mln stg in the money market today. Among the main factors affecting liquidity, bills maturing in official hands and the take-up of treasury bills will drain some 1.61 billion stg. Partly offsetting this outflow, exchequer transactions and a fall in note circulation will add around 425 mln stg and 360 mln stg respectively. In addition, bankers\\' balances above target will add some 20 mln stg to the system today. TURKISH CENTRAL BANK SETS LIRA/DOLLAR, DM RATES The Turkish Central Bank set a Lira/Dollar rate for March 10 of 773.05/776.92 to the Dollar, down from the previous 769.60/773.45. The Bank also set a Lira/Mark rate of 417.20/419.29 to the Mark, up from the previous 419.15/421.25. FED EXPECTED TO ADD TEMPORARY RESERVES The Federal Reserve is expected to intervene in the government securities market to add temporary reserves via customer repurchase agreements, economists said. Most economists said the Fed will add 1.5 to two billion dlrs of temporary reserves via customer repurchase agreements, but some said there is a slim chance the Fed will inject permanent reserves via three-day system repurchase agreements. Federal funds opened at 6-1/16 pct and firmed to 6-1/8 pct in early trading. Funds averaged six pct on Friday. UK MONEY RATES FALL AS BANK APPROVES BASE RATE CUT A half point cut in base lending rates was announced by the big four clearing banks today after the Bank of England finally endorsed such a move following weeks of downward pressure, dealers said. During its routine intervention in the market, the bank trimmed the rates at which it deals with the discount houses by half a point and National Westminster led the other clearing banks in reducing its base rate to 10-1/2 pct from 11 pct. The timing of the Bank of England move took operators by surprise after its recent action seemingly designed to dampen hopes of a base rate cut ahead of the U.K. Budget on March 17. For some time, fundamentals have led the market to push for a one point cut in base lending rates to 10 pct but the central bank has declined to follow wholesale money market rates down. Although political considerations -- the government\\'s wish to see a fall in base rates coincide with the Budget -- had been suggested by operators last week as reasons for the Bank\\'s delaying action, worries about the real strength of sterling and perhaps about the market\\'s reaction to the content of the Budget may have been behind the central bank\\'s caution, dealers said. In the event, sterling continued firm after the rate cut, leaving the market still looking for another half point fall. Consequently, rates in the money market eased during the day, one-month interbank sterling shedding 5/16 point to 10-9/16 7/16 and three-months trading 1/16 point down at 10-5/16 3/16 pct. Sterling cd\\'s were similarly down between 5/16 point in one month and 1/8 point in one year. Overnight interbank money for tomorrow was indicated at around 11 pct, almost a point below the levels ruling at the end of last week. Today, overnight touched a high of some 11-3/4 pct after the Bank took out 228 mln stg of an estimated 300 mln stg shortage. FED SETS 2.5 BILLION DLR CUSTOMER REPURCHASE, FED SAYS FED SETS 2.5 BILLION DLR CUSTOMER REPURCHASE, FED SAYS FED ADDS RESERVES VIA CUSTOMER REPURCHASES The Federal Reserve entered the U.S. Government securities market to arrange 2.5 billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreements, a Fed spokesman said. Dealers said Federal funds were trading at 6-3/16 pct when the Fed began its temporary and indirect supply of reserves to the banking system. BANK OF ZAMBIA PAYS OUT FOREIGN CURRENCY ARREARS The Bank of Zambia has paid out foreign exchange arrears from three auctions conducted last year, a bank spokesman said. \"We have now cleared three auctions and are left with only four, worth eight mln dlrs,\" the spokesman said without specifying the amount paid out. The bank had not paid foreign exchange to private firms since it suspended the weekly auctions on January 28. It has said the auctions were suspended because it planned to introduce a modified system after talks with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. President Kenneth Kaunda announced last month that the auction would be retained for allocating foreign exchange to approved private sector bidders, but would not be used to determine the kwacha\\'s exchange rate. Last week, he said the auction had run into trouble because of a shortage of foreign exchange. The government has fixed the exchange rate at nine kwacha per dollar, effectively revaluing the kwacha by 67.7 pct. USX &lt;X> CHAIRMAN CALLS FOR LOWER DOLLAR USX Corp chairman David Roderick called for a lower value for the U.S. dollar against other currencies to help speed a correction in the U.S. trade deficit, which last year reached 170 billion dlrs. In remarks prepared for a speech before the Economic Club of Detroit, Roderick said, \"There should be total resolve that the dollar versus other major currencies, as well as the currencies of other nations having a substantial trade surplus with us, must continue to decline so that the correction in our trade deficit starts on the road to recovery.\" Roderick said the U.S. should be understanding of the \"economic pain\" our trading partners experience as a result of a falling dollar. But, he added, \"As painful as the correction may be to our trading partners, it is less painful than leaving the problem uncorrected because that would lead us into an inevitable, lengthy and steep world recession.\" Roderick said between February 1985 and December 1986 the dollar fell by more than 40 pct in real terms against major industrial currencies and by 30 to 35 pct against a broader group of currencies of nearly all developing nations. At the end of 1986, he said, the value of foreign assets in the U.S. exceeded the value of U.S. assets abroad by 240 billion dlrs, compared to five years ago when the U.S. had a surplus in assets of 141 billion. A company spokesman said the data were provided by economic consultants to USX. The primary reason for the trade imbalance was the 70 pct rise of the dollar between 1980 and 1985, although other factors were involved, Roderick said. But it is wrong, he said, \"to attribute the massive trade deficit to a fundmental deterioration of U.S. productivity or of American product quality.\" These areas need to be improved but they are not the root cause of the trade gap problem, Roderick said. He urged American manufacturers to become more competitive so they can compete in global markets. In the speech, the USX chairman also called for changes in securities laws to curb what he called abuses by corporate raiders and speculators. Among his proposals, which he presented to the Senate Banking Committee in testimony last week, were a requirement that raiders give 24-hour notice for every one pct of stock they acquire in a company. Roderick proposed that tender offers must be made for all cash to all stockholders on equal terms and that raiders be required to have financing in place before a tender is made. Further, raiders should be required to make an all-cash tender offer once they acquire 10 pct of a target company\\'s stock, he said. And payment of greenmail, or a preferential price by a target company to buy back a raider\\'s stake, should be prohibited under the revised laws. Roderick said changes were necessary to curb abuses but that he did not want laws that would hurt the financial markets or discourage \"fair price to all\" takeovers. CENTRAL BANKERS SATISFIED WITH PARIS ACCORD Central bankers said they were generally satisfied with the response to the Paris accord two weeks ago to stabilize currencies at around current levels. Speaking after a meeting at the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), which reviewed the agreement, they also welcomed interest rates cuts in France and today\\'s drop in British rates.  One top official said the rate cuts would help to stimulate growth generally in Europe and welcomed that countries other than West Germany were seen to be helping sustain the economy. The central bankers, who spoke on the condition they not be named, said the meeting of governors from the Group of 10 countries also heard a report from Michel Camdessus, the new managing director of the International Monetary Fund, on the IMF\\'s latest assessment of the debt crisis. In particular, they discussed Brazil\\'s debt moratorium. But there was no sense of urgency, they said, and Brazil had made no appeal for bridging loans from the BIS or central banks. U.S. PAYMENTS GAP TO PERSIST, EX-FED CHIEF SAYS The dollar will decline over the next two to three years, but this is unlikely to result in a complete reduction of the U.S. current account deficit, said Anthony Solomon, chairman of S.G. Warburg (USA) Inc and former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. In a presentation to the Japan Society, Solomon said without elaboration that he expects a \"significant decline in the dollar,\" within the next three years. \"The dollar will fall more, but the current account deficit will stop being reduced when it reaches its structural core,\" he said. Solomon described the structural core as about one-half of the current 150 billion dlr annual deficit. He cited several factors which will prevent an elimination of the deficit. For one thing, it is unlikely that there will be any new investment in those manufacturing industries that shrank when the dollar was at uncompetitive levels, he said. In addition, he said that the U.S. has an increased propensity to import in order to satisify consumer tastes. Solomon forecast inflation at 4.5 pct by year-end, but said it could be kept below five pct in the medium-term if oil prices are stable and commodity values remain low. U.K. MONEY MARKET SHORTAGE FORECAST REVISED DOWN The Bank of England said it revised its forecast of the shortage in the money market down to around 700 mln stg from its original estimate of 800 mln. U.K. MONEY MARKET RECEIVES 37 MLN STG ASSISTANCE The Bank of England said it had provided the money market with 37 mln stg assistance in the morning session. This compares with the Bank\\'s downward revised estimate of the shortfall in the system today of around 700 mln stg. The central bank purchased bank bills outright comprising four mln stg in band one at 10-7/8 pct and 33 mln stg in band two at 10-13/16 pct. WORLD BANK REPORT CRITICISES PERU ECONOMIC PLAN A confidential World Bank report on the Peruvian economy has said the government\\'s strategy does not offer good prospects for medium and long-term growth and is likely to lead to an early renewal of inflationary pressure. The report, published today by the economic monthly, The Peru Report, said the success of president Alan Garcia\\'s government in stimulating output last year to achieve a growth in gross domestic product of over eight pct \"represents gains in the short term at the expense of the long.\" Government officials had no immediate comment on the report, which advised a reduction in the overall size of the public investment program and greater emphasis on the preservation of Peru\\'s export potential. The report said that although the government had succeeded in cutting inflation from 250 pct a year in the first half of 1985 to under 70 pct, its stabilisation and reactivation program was encountering rising difficulties. \"An early renewal of inflationary pressures, linked to monetary expansion, exchange rate devaluation and an easing of price controls, appears not improbable,\" it added. The world bank report said the government\\'s policies had reduced inflation and short-term increases in consumption at the apparent cost of price distortions, overvaluation of the currency, balance of payments disequilibrium, reserve losses, and sharply diminished creditworthiness. It said unless the government took action quickly to fix a competitive exchange rate and control the public sector deficit, \"the higher the probability will be that the government will eventually have to resort to drastic curtailment of domestic demand and either sharp devaluation or still further controls on imports in order to stem inflation and support the balance of payments.\" It said the bank would place more emphasis on the preservation of peru\\'s export potential, external links and overall economic efficiency. The government\\'s incentive policies towards the mining and petroleum sectors, among its main traditional exports, suggested that it did not accord high priority to their economic viability, it added. U.S. INTERVENED TO BUY 50 MLN DLRS AGAINST YEN ON JANUARY 28, FED SAYS U.S. INTERVENED TO BUY 50 MLN DLRS AGAINST YEN ON JANUARY 28, FED SAYS U.S. INTERVENED TO AID DLR IN JANUARY, FED SAYS U.S. authorities intervened in the foreign exchange market to support the dollar on one occasion during the period between the start of November 1986 and the end of January, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said in a report. The Fed\\'s quarterly review of foreign exchange operations said that the U.S. bought 50 mln dlrs through the sale of yen on January 28. This operation was coordinated with the Japanese monetary authorities and was funded equally by the Fed and the U.S. Treasury. The Fed\\'s intervention was on the morning after president Reagan\\'s State of the Union message and was \"in a manner consistent with the joint statement\" made by U.S. Treasury secretary James Baker and Japanese finance minister Kiichi Miyazawa after their January 21 consultations. At that meeting, the two reaffirmed their willingness to cooperate on exchange rate issues. The Fed\\'s report did not say at what level the intervention occurred. But on January 28, the dollar closed at 151.50/60 yen after dipping as low as 150.40 yen earlier in the session. It had closed at 151.05/15 yen the previous day. The dollar had plumbed a post-World War II low of 149.98 yen on January 19 and reached a seven-year low of 1.7675 marks on January 28. It ended that day at 1.7820/30 marks. The Fed noted that, after trading steadily throughout November and the first half of December, the dollar moved sharply lower until the end of January. It closed the three-month review period down more than 11 pct against the mark and most other Continental currencies and seven pct lower against the yen and sterling. It had fallen four pct against the Canadian dollar. During the final days of January, pressure on the dollar subsided. Reports of the U.S.-Japanese intervention operation and talk of an upcoming meeting of the major industrial countries encouraged expectations for broader cooperation on exchange rate and economic policy matters, the Fed said. Moreover, doubts had developed about the course of U.S. interest rates. The dollar\\'s swift fall had raised questions about whether the Fed would let short-term rates ease. Thus the dollar firmed to close the period at 1.8320 marks and 153.70 yen. According to the Fed\\'s trade-weighted index, it had declined nine pct since the beginning of the period. The dollar had risen as high as 2.08 marks and 165 yen in early November. The Fed last intervened in the foreign exchange market on November 7, 1985 when it bought a total of 102.2 mln dlrs worth of marks and yen. The Fed\\'s action followed the September 1985 Plaza agreement between the five major industrial nations under which they agreed to promote an orderly decline of the dollar. MIYAZAWA SAYS PARIS ACCORD HELPING STABILISE RATES Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said the Paris currency accord has contributed to the stability of exchange rates. Miyazawa told a press conference the agreement reached last month in Paris by six major industrial nations to cooperate in bringing about currency stability has prevented speculative concerns from being active in money centres. The decision in Paris is being understood by the market, he said. The yen-dollar exchange rate has been moving in a narrow range since finance ministers of Britain, Canada, France, Japan, the U.S. And West Germany reached the accord. AUSTRALIAN RESERVE BANK IN BUYING INTERVENTION The Reserve Bank said at 1230 local time it was offering to buy short-dated government securities in the short-term money market. The bank\\'s action followed its purchase of short-dated government stock and six-day repurchase agreements earlier in the session. Money market traders said the move was aimed at easing cash market interest rates which had risen on demand for funds to meet PAYE tax and treasury note settlement commitments. CHINA ALLOWS NATIONWIDE FOREIGN EXCHANGE SAVING People throughout China can now open foreign exchange accounts at the Bank of China, the official Shenzhen Economic Zone Daily said. Previously only residents of Guangdong and Fujian provinces could do this. The paper also said the minimum for opening a fixed deposit account had been cut to 50 yuan equivalent, from 150 yuan. The minimum for a current account is 20 yuan equivalent. The paper said depositors could now withdraw all or part of their account, subject to a branch\\'s reserves, instead of only a fixed amount as previously. The paper said deposits may now be opened in French francs as well as the already available U.S. Dollar, Hong Kong dollar, sterling, yen and marks. Bank of China branches in Hainan island also accept deposits in Singapore dollars, and those in Wenzhou, Zhejiang province, accept deposits in Dutch guilders, the paper said. It gave no further details. HUNGARY TO DEVALUE FORINT AGAINST WESTERN UNITS Hungary is to devalue the forint by an average of eight pct against Western currencies, the official news agency MTI said. MTI did not say when the devaluation would become effective, but it expected new rates to be announced later today. Hungary devalued the forint by a similar amount last September 23. Western bankers say the forint is more realistically valued than currencies of Hungary\\'s COMECON allies. U.K. MONEY MARKET SHORTAGE FORECAST AT 300 MLN STG The Bank of England said it forecast a liquidity shortage of around 300 mln stg in the market today. Among the main factors, the Bank said bills maturing in official hands and the treasury bill take-up would drain 483 mln stg from the system while below target bankers\\' balances and a rise in the note circulation would take out 50 mln and 100 mln stg respectively. Partially offsetting these, exchequer transactions would add around 355 mln stg, the Bank added. BELGIAN CENTRAL BANK BUYS CURRENCY TO REPAY DEBT The Belgian National Bank bought foreign currencies against francs on the open market in the week ended March 9, a Bank spokesman said. In line with central bank policy he declined to give any details of the amount bought. The foreign currency purchased was used by the Treasury to repay foreign debt and did not affect the Bank\\'s foreign exchange reserves. They slipped 394 mln francs to 37.33 billion, mostly due to sales of dollars for Special Drawing Rights, the spokesman said. INDONESIAN BANKS RAISE INTEREST RATES A tight money market has pushed interest rates on three to six month time deposits to between 15 and 18 pct from 13 to 15 pct a month ago, bankers said. March is usually a tight month for the money market because of tax payments and banks\\' need to attract funds for their year-end accounts on March 31. This year the situation has been made worse by December\\'s rush to buy dollars by companies and businessmen who feared imposition of exchange controls. Much of that outflow has yet to be converted back into rupiah. \"A lot of small money has come back in, but the big money is holding out until after April,\" one U.S. Banker said. The tight money policy of Bank Indonesia, the central bank, is helping to keep rates high. Short-term lending rates now average 25 pct a year, with no prospect they will be lowered soon, the bankers said. Central Bank governor Arifin Siregar said earlier this week that Indonesia could look forward to better economic prospects in 1987/88, but added the \"speculators\" who led a run on the rupiah late last year could again pose problems. Indonesia holds general elections on April 23, the first in five years, and most businessmen expect no new government economic packages or incentives before then. \"Some people are nervous about what the government will do after the election,\" one banker said. \"They normally try to do things before the IGGI (Inter-Governmental Group on Indonesia) meeting (in June) to prove they are doing something about the economy to show they deserve a couple of billion dollars.\" The IGGI, which groups 14 industrialised donor countries and four agencies, gave Indonesia 2.5 billion dlrs in soft loans and grants last year. GERMAN CALL MONEY EASES AFTER LIQUIDITY INJECTION Call money eased to 3.75/80 pct from 3.80/85 yesterday following a net injection of 6.7 billion marks at a rate of 3.80 pct in fresh funds from this week\\'s securities repurchase agreement, dealers said. But rates were expected to rise toward the end of the week. A major tax payment period by banks on behalf of customers, payments for the federal railways loan stock and repayments of mark liabilities incurred by foreign central banks with the Bundesbank in the framework of the European Monetary System (EMS) are likely to significantly burden the system. Banks built up minimum reserves today, ahead of the expected outflow. The Bundesbank credited banks with a gross 15.2 billion marks, but some 8.5 billion left the system at the same time as an earlier securities repurchase pact matured. Dealers estimated the EMS related outflow as high as six billion marks. The Bundesbank declined to comment, but a spokesman said yesterday although the funds now due may be allowed to roll over, the possibility that other central banks may choose to redeem them meant a net infusion was needed. Dealers forecast tax payments of 25 and 30 billion marks, but much of it is expected to burden the system only next week. Banks\\' minimum reserve holdings at the Bundesbank totalled 53.6 billion marks on Monday, averaging 54.0 billion over the first nine days of March. Dealers said although the figure was well above an expected requirement of around 51 billion marks, the expected outflow of funds was so large that banks might find it difficult to meet the requirement toward the end of March. No securities repurchase agreement is expiring next week, but dealers said the Bundesbank could offer fresh liquidity if conditions significantly tighten. \"The Bundesbank wants to keep rates around 3.80 pct,\" one dealer said. HUNGARY TO DEVALUE FORINT AGAINST WESTERN UNITS Hungary is to devalue the forint by an average of eight pct against Western currencies, the official news agency MTI said. MTI did not say when the devaluation would become effective, but it expected new rates to be announced later today. Hungary devalued the forint by a similar amount last September 23. Western bankers say the forint is more realistically valued than currencies of Hungary\\'s COMECON allies. JAPAN CANNOT BEAR FURTHER YEN RISE, MINISTER SAYS Japan cannot bear a further rise of the yen, Foreign Minister Tadashi Kuranari said. \"A further stronger yen would be a misfortune for Japan and the Japanese people would not be able to bear such a burden,\" he told reporters. The minister said he wants to tell U.S. Political leaders of the sacrifices Japan is making to cut its trade surplus. Kuranari was widely expected to fly to Washington tomorrow for talks focussing on trade. But departure remains uncertain because of the continuing parliamentary boycott by opposition parties protesting plans for a new sales tax. If the boycott is lifted tomorrow, Kuranari would probably have to remain in Japan to attend parliamentary discussions on the government\\'s 1987/88 budget, Japanese officials said. Kuranari said both the U.S. And Japan should approach the trade imbalance in a calm, unemotional manner. But, he added, \"If the issue of rice is to be raised...I would mention the feelings of the Japanese people.\" Japanese politicians have said repeatedly the country cannot bow to U.S. Pressure to liberalize rice imports because the issue is too sensitive. BANK OF ENGLAND DOES NOT INTERVENE IN MONEY MARKET The Bank of England said it did not operate in the money market during the morning. Initially, the bank forecast a liqudity shortage of some 300 mln stg for the market today. Overnight interbank sterling traded at the 11-1/4 1/8 pct level for most of the morning while period rates have eased on the strength of sterling, dealers said. At 1200 gmt, sterling\\'s trade-weighted index was up 0.6 at 72.7. POUND AND CANADIAN DOLLAR CAPTURING ATTENTION Interest in the currency futures market has shifted to the soaring British pound and the potentially explosive Canadian dollar, and away from the dull Continental and Japanese currencies, analysts said. The June pound, which added 6.3 cents over the past week-and-a-half to reach a new contract high of 1.5930 to the dollar on Monday, has spawned a new-found speculative boom. \"Brokers have to push their clients somewhere...and technically, the pound is in the best shape,\" PaineWebber analyst Jason Gillard said. \"We\\'ve tried to take a bullish approach to the pound, and we\\'re going to stay with that, there\\'s no reason to change,\" Smith Barney analyst Craig Sloane said. Many traders took on long pound/short West German mark futures positions, although some of those cross-trades were liquidated yesterday, Sloane said. The fundamental keys to the pound\\'s rise have been relatively high U.K. interest rates and a vague optimism surrounding the British economy, analysts said. \"Money seems to be chasing yields,\" William Byers, of Bear Stearns, said of the 10-1/2 pct U.K. base lending rate. Many analysts are skeptical about further gains in the pound, on the inference that the Bank of England will seek to relieve upward pressure on the currency by pushing down interest rates after the nation\\'s budget is released March 17. The budget itself could have an impact, depending on how well it is received, but analysts say relative interest rates and oil income remain the main influences on the currency. However, the market may be able to absorb lower U.K. interest rates, as it has done when other countries have cut their discount rates, and extend the pound\\'s rally, Sloane said. The Canadian dollar has not been rising like the pound, but Sloane and other analysts cautiously predicted a big move soon. The sideways price pattern in the June contract, with smaller and smaller price ranges, has formed a \"bull flag\" on price charts, technically-oriented analysts said. \"It makes for an explosive type of situation that often leads to a breakout,\" in this case to the upside, Sloane said. Byers agreed there was potential for the June Canadian dollar to rally above the 77.00 cent level from the most recent close at 74.80 cents to the U.S. dollar. \"At this stage of the game I\\'d call the market long-term positive, but for the technical burden of proof you need a close above (the previous contract high of) 75.25,\" Byers said. As to the traditionally more active currencies, stability was the catchword and reluctance the watchword among analysts. Sloane said it was important that June Swiss francs and June German marks held above support at 0.6400 and 0.5400, respectively, closing at 0.6438 and 0.5430. Yesterday\\'s rebound showed the market was still very respectful of the Paris accord, and the threat of central bank intervention by the G-5 nations plus Canada. \"We may still probe to see what the parameters are,\" Byers said, \"but people are very reluctant because they don\\'t know where the central banks will be (to intervene).\" Gillard said the mark could drop to a previous price consolidation area around 0.5250 based on the profoundly sluggish West German economy, but that he would be a buyer at that level. SWISS SIGHT DEPOSITS FALL 2.88 BILLION FRANCS Sight deposits of commercial banks at the Swiss National Bank fell 2.88 billion Swiss francs in the first 10 days of March to 7.65 billion, the National Bank said. Foreign exchange reserves rose 3.30 billion francs to 33.94 billion. Sight deposits are a major indicator of money market liquidity in Switzerland. The National Bank said banks paid back 5.5 billion francs of central bank credit taken out at the end of February for the end-month liquidity requirement. This drain was offset in part by new currency swaps, which had the effect of increasing the National Bank\\'s foreign exchange holdings. Bank notes in circulation fell 309.1 mln francs to 24.49 billion, and other deposits on call -- basically government funds -- rose 1.06 billion to 2.10 billion. U.K. MONEY MARKET GIVEN 106 MLN STG ASSISTANCE The Bank of England said it gave the money market assistance worth 106 mln stg this afternoon, buying bank bills at the rates established on Monday. The Bank bought 11 mln stg of band one bills at 10-3/8 pct and 95 mln stg of band two paper at 10-5/16 pct. This is the first time that it has intervened today. The Bank has revised its estimate of the liquidity shortage in the market down to 250 mln stg from 300 mln initially. HUNGARY HOPES DEVALUATION WILL END TRADE DEFICIT National Bank of Hungary first vice-president Janos Fekete said he hoped a planned eight pct devaluation of the forint will spur exports and redress last year\\'s severe trade deficit with the West. Fekete told Reuters in an interview Hungary must achieve at least equilibrium on its hard currency trade. \"It is useful to have a devaluation,\" he said. \"There is now a real push to our exports and a bit of a curb to our imports.\" The official news agency MTI said today Hungary would devalue by eight pct and it expected the new rates to be announced later today. Fekete said the rates would come into effect tomorrow. He said one reason for the devaluation was that Hungary had a higher rate of inflation over the past two years than its main partners (around eight pct in 1985 and between five and 5.5 pct in 1986). This was partly an after-effect of action Hungary took to prevent inflation from soaring during the oil price shocks of the 1970s, he added. Hungary devalued by a similar amount last September and by between three and four pct early last year. But the country\\'s hard currency trade balance nevertheless fell into a deficit of 539.4 mln dlrs from a surplus of 295.3 mln in 1986 and 1.2 billion in 1985. Fekete said Hungary was hoping for a hard currency trade surplus of between 200 and 300 mln dlrs this year, but that a more likely outcome would be closer to equilibrium on total hard currency trade of around 10 billion dlrs. One Western commercial attache here said: \"Devaluation of itself will not change anything. It will only be useful if they also make efforts to restructure industry and improve the quality of their export goods.\" Fekete said he hoped to raise credits on good terms this year to invest in restructuring industry. It would be his role to persuade international banks to cooperate in this process. He noted Hungary had been given an AA rating enabling it to raise money on the Japanese Samurai bond market. Hungary\\'s net hard currency debt soared to 7.79 billion dlrs last year from 5.01 billion in 1985, partly because of a current account deficit of 1.42 billion dlrs and partly because the fall in the dollar increased the dollar value of debt denominated in marks or yen. He said he feared net debt would also rise slightly this year, but he was in favour of borrowing for the purpose of modernisation. \"I am for credits to invest for that purpose,\" he said. \"I am against credits for consumption.\" He forecast gross domestic product growth of two pct this year, from one pct in 1986. Fekete said Hungary would continue to restructure its debt profile by prepaying high interest shorter and medium term loans with cheaper long term money for which it was looking more and more to the fixed interest rate bond market, where he considered rates to be low. Hard currency foreign exchange reserves would stay at around 3.5 billion dlrs, he said. On the budget deficit, which tripled to a provisional 47 billion forints last year after quadrupling in 1985, Fekete said the finance ministry was working out measures to reduce an approved target deficit for this year of 43.8 billion forints to between 30 and 35 billion forints. U.K. MONEY MARKET GIVEN LATE HELP OF 240 MLN STG The Bank of England said it provided the money market with unspecified late assistance of around 240 mln stg. This brings its total assistance on the day to 346 mln stg compared with a liquidity shortfall it estimated at a revised 250 mln stg. Overnight interbank sterling was being offered at eight pct shortly after the Bank\\'s announcement. DEALERS WARY OVER STERLING INTERVENTION RUMOUR Foreign exchange market rumours that the the Bank of England has been selling sterling to halt its rise prompted a wary response from dealers who said they saw no obvious confirmation, market sources said. Bank of England officials were not immediately available for comment. Earlier this week, the Bank sanctioned a cut in bank interest rates in a surprise move, which aimed at limiting sterling\\'s rise ahead of the March 17 budget. But today the pound has strengthened to 72.7 on its trade-weighted index from 72.1 last night, though the U.K. Currency is below its day\\'s high against the dollar. FED EXPECTED TO ADD RESERVES The Federal Reserve is expected to intervene in the government securities market to add temporary reserves via customer or system repurchase agreements, economists said. Most economists said the Fed will inject reserves indirectly via customer repurchases, but they added that the Fed might opt for a direct injection of reserves via overnight system repurchases. Federal funds opened at 6-3/8 pct and eased to 6-5/16 pct in early trading. Funds averaged 6.29 pct yesterday. FED SETS TWO BILLION DLR CUSTOMER REPURCHASE, FED SAYS FED SETS TWO BILLION DLR CUSTOMER REPURCHASE, FED SAYS FED ADDS RESERVES VIA CUSTOMER REPURCHASES The Federal Reserve entered the U.S. Government securities market to arrange two billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreements, a Fed spokesman said. Dealers said Federal funds were trading at 6-5/16 pct when the Fed began its temporary and indirect supply of reserves to the banking system. TREASURY SECRETARY BAKER DECLINES COMMENT ON G-6 U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker declined comment on the February 22 Paris accord between the six major industrial nations under which they agreed to foster exchange rate stability. Asked by reporters after a speech before the National Fitness Foundation banquet what, if any, currency intervention levels had been set in Paris, Baker replied: \"We never talk about intervention.\" Baker also declined to comment on his views about the foreign exchange markets\\' reaction to the accord. BANK OF ENGLAND OFFERS EARLY HELP IN MONEY MARKET The Bank of England said it had invited the discount houses to make an early round of bill offers to help offset a large liquidity shortage in the money market. It estimated the shortage at around 1.55 billion stg, one adverse factor being the unwinding of a sale and repurchase agreement, with the market having to buy back bills worth 542 mln stg from the Bank. Bills maturing in official hands and the treasury bill take-up would drain 957 mln stg wile exchequer transactions and a note circulation rise would take out 15 mln and 25 mln respectively. Above target bankers\\' balances would add 10 mln. U.K. MONEY MARKET GIVEN EARLY ASSISTANCE The Bank of England said it had bought bills worth 1.059 billion stg from the market for resale on March 31 at rates of interest between 10-7/16 pct and 10-17/32 pct. Earlier, the Bank said it estimated the liquidity shortage in the market today at around 1.55 billion stg. TAIWAN CLAMPS NEW CONTROLS ON CURRENCY INFLOWS Taiwan\\'s new controls on currency inflows, implemented today, are a desperate bid to stem a flood of speculative money prompted by the local currency surge against the U.S. Dollar, local and foreign bankers said. The central bank now has to clear remittances exceeding one mln U.S. Dlrs earned from exports, shipping and insurance and bank lending plus remittances of more than 10,000 dlrs from any other source. Petitioners have to show their remittances relate to genuine commercial transactions. Meanwhile, traders are no longer required to report all outward payments concerning invisible trade, including freight, insurance and royalties, to the central bank. But bankers said they believed the new controls would be ineffective since businessmen could split up remittances into smaller units or simply remit money through Taiwan\\'s flourishing currency black market. The bankers said the controls, announced on March 6, are a panic reaction to U.S. Pressure, which has intensified over the past week, for a faster appreciation of the Taiwan dollar to slow the growth of Taiwan\\'s exports to the U.S. The government has denied local press reports Washington is pressing for an exchange rate of up to 28 dlrs. The Taiwan dollar opened four cents up today at 34.70. \"I don\\'t think the central bank has a final target,\" said an executive with a U.S. Bank. Other bankers and economists said they are wary of making any firm predictions about how far the Taiwan dollar will rise. Taiwan\\'s trade surplus with the U.S. Hit 13.6 billion U.S. Dlrs last year against 10.2 billion in 1985. The surplus widened in the first two months of the year to 2.35 billion dlrs from 1.87 billion in the same period last year. Economists estimate up to five billion dlrs in speculative money flowed into Taiwan in 1986. This inflow helped boost foreign exchange reserves to more than 51 billion dlrs from just under 25 billion this time last year and provided further upward pressure on the currency. The Taiwan dollar has appreciated by almost 15 pct against the U.S. Currency since September 1985, further encouraging speculators. Central bank governor Chang Chi-cheng said last week Washington\\'s pressure plus rising foreign exchange reserves meant a further strengthening in the currency is inevitable. Many local bankers argue the only effective solution to the currency problem is to drop foreign exchange controls and allow the local dollar to find its own level. \"Lifting exchange controls is the final answer, but the central bank is not prepared to do it. It simply does not want to take the risk,\" said one local banker. He said he believed the new restrictions are a temporary measure designed to buy time as the central bank grapples with the exchange rate problem. The restrictions are a bureaucratic imposition and skirt around the real issue, he said. Taiwan needs a fundamental restructuring of foreign exchange controls, said an executive with a western bank. \"The controls will create more paperwork, but the extra bank charges will not outweigh the profits of speculation,\" said the manager of a European bank. Economists criticised the controls, saying they could antagonise Washington, which is pushing for further economic liberalisation in Taiwan. \"Instead of liberalising outflows, the government has restricted inflows,\" said Kate Newman, an economist with Vickers da Costa. A local banker, who declined to be named, said, \"It\\'s basically ridiculous. It\\'s a backward movement and goes against the government\\'s liberalisation programme.\" Taiwan last year eased some of its financial regulations to enable Taiwan nationals to invest in foreign government bonds, treasury bills and certificates of deposit and to allow individuals to take 5,000 U.S. Dlrs in cash out of the country each year. U.K. MONEY MARKET OFFERED BORROWING FACILTIES The Bank of England said it had offered borrowing facilities to those discount houses wishing to use them at 1430 GMT. The Bank also said it provided the money market 456 mln stg assistance in the afternoon session bringing its total help so far today to 493 mln stg. This compares with its forecast of a shortage in the system today of around 700 mln stg. The central bank purchased bank bills outright comprising 41 mln stg in band one at 10-7/8 pct 361 mln stg in band two at 10-13/16 pct and 54 mln stg in band three at 10-3/4 pct. Money market dealers said the Bank of England has recently used the offer of borrowing facilities to signal that it does not want to see an early reduction in U.K. Base lending rates. The Bank does this by lending to the discount houses at rates of interest higher than its prevailing money market dealing rates. U.K. MONEY MARKET GIVEN FURTHER 442 MLN STG HELP The Bank of England said it provided the market with a further 442 mln stg assistance during the morning to offset a liquidity shortage it estimated at 1.60 billion stg, revised up from 1.55 billion The bank bought outright eight mln stg of band one treasury bills and five mln stg of band one bank bills at 10-3/8 pct. It bought a further 429 mln stg of bills for resale to the discount houses on April 2 at an interest rate of 10-7/16 pct. So far today, the bank has given the market assistance worth a total of 1.501 billion stg. TREASURY SECRETARY BAKER DECLINES COMMENT ON G-6 U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker declined comment on the February 22 Paris accord between the six major industrial nations under which they agreed to foster exchange rate stability. Asked by reporters after a speech before the National Fitness Foundation banquet what, if any, currency intervention levels had been set in Paris, Baker replied: \"We never talk about intervention.\" Baker also declined to comment on his views about the foreign exchange markets\\' reaction to the accord. BANKERS OPPOSE STRICT TAIWAN CURRENCY CONTROLS Taiwan imposed currency controls today in what bankers called a desperate move to prevent speculation as the Taiwan dollar appreciated against the U.S. currency. The strict controls will require proof that large remittances to Taiwan are connected to commercial transactions rather than currency speculation. Bankers attacked the controls as ineffective, saying they were a panic reaction to pressure from Washington for faster appreciation of the Taiwan currency against the U.S. dollar, which would slow exports to the United States. Remittances exceeding one mln dlrs earned through exports, shipping, insurance or bank lending will now need government approval, along with remittances of more than 10,000 dlrs from any other source. UK MONEY MARKET GIVEN FURTHER TWO MLN STG HELP The Bank of England said it gave the market further assistance of two mln stg during the afternoon, buying that amount of band two bank bills at 10-5/16 pct. The bank has given the market assistance worth 1.503 billion stg today to offset a shortage it estimated at a revised 1.60 billion. FED NOT EXPECTED TO ADD RESERVES The Federal Reserve is not expected to intervene in the government securities market today, several economists said. They said the Fed does not have a much of an adding need this week and may wait until tomorrow or Monday before supplying reserves. But a few economists said there was an outside chance that the Fed may inject reserves indirectly via a small round of customer repurchase agreements. Federal funds hovered at 6-1/8 pct this morning after averaging 6.32 pct yesterday. FED SAYS IT SETS TWO BILLION DLRS OF CUSTOMER REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS FED SAYS IT SETS TWO BILLION DLRS OF CUSTOMER REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS FED ADDS RESERVES VIA CUSTOMER REPURCHASES The Federal Reserve entered the U.S. Government securities market to arrange two billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreements, a spokeswoman said. Dealers said Federal funds were trading at 6-1/8 pct when the Fed began its temporary and indirect supply of reserves to the banking system. MIYAZAWA SAYS EXCHANGE RATES WILL STAY STABLE Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told a press conference he thinks exchange rates will remain stable due to the currency accord reached in Paris last month by six major industrialised nations but he did not say for how long. The dollar has hovered around 153 yen since the six agreed to cooperate to bring about currency stability. Asked to comment on remarks by some U.S. Officials calling for a further decline of the dollar, Miyazawa said only the U.S. President and the U.S. Treasury Secretary can make official statements about exchange rates. JAPAN MINISTER SAYS ABOUT 170 YEN APPROPRIATE International Trade and Industry Minister Hajime Tamura told a parliamentary session Japan\\'s small- and medium-sized enterprises are seriously suffering from the yen\\'s rise and can only stand levels around 170 yen. He also said he still believes a dollar exchange rate level plus or minus 10 yen from 170 yen would be within levels agreed upon last month in Paris by six major industrial nations. Finance ministers of Britain, Canada, France, Japan, the U.S. And West Germany agreed on February 22 to cooperate in stabilizing exchange rates around the current levels. The dollar had closed here at 153.77 yen on February 20. BANK OF ENGLAND OFFERS EARLY HELP TO MONEY MARKET The Bank of England said it invited an early round of bill offers to help ease tight conditions in the money market. The bank estimated today\\'s liquidity shortage at about 1.10 billion stg. Bills maturing in official hands and the treasury bill take-up would drain 1.21 billion stg from the system while a rise in the note circulation and below target bankers\\' balances would take out 265 mln and 180 mln respectively, the bank said. Against this, exchequer transactions would add a net 535 mln stg. Miyazawa says current dollar/yen rate not necessarily satisfactory Miyazawa says current dollar/yen rate not necessarily satisfactory MIYAZAWA SAYS PRESENT YEN NOT NECESSARILY IDEAL Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told a parliamentary session the current dollar/yen exchange rate is not necessarily satisfactory for the Japanese economy. Miyazawa said the Paris currency accord among six major industrial nations last month does not necessarily mean the yen should stay stable around current levels in the future. The Paris agreement was aimed at stopping a further rapid fluctuation of exchange rates, he said. The accord stipulated that current rates reflect fundamentals of the six nations - Britain, Canada, France, Japan, the U.S. And West Germany. U.K. MONEY MARKET GIVEN 478 MLN STG EARLY HELP The Bank of England said it provided the market with 478 mln stg of early assistance to help ease a liquidity shortage it estimated at 1.10 billion stg. It made outright purchases of seven mln stg of band one bank bills at 10-3/8 pct and 30 mln stg of band two bank bills at 10-5/16 pct. In addition, it bought 294 mln stg of paper for resale to the market on March 30 and 147 mln stg for resale on April 8, in both cases at an interest rate of 10-7/16 pct. MIYAZAWA SAYS PRESENT YEN NOT NECESSARILY IDEAL Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told a parliamentary session the current dollar/yen exchange rate is not necessarily satisfactory for the Japanese economy. Miyazawa said the Paris currency accord among six major industrial nations last month does not necessarily mean the yen should stay stable around current levels in the future. The Paris agreement was aimed at stopping a further rapid fluctuation of exchange rates, he said.

He also said he still believes a dollar exchange rate level plus or minus 10 yen from 170 yen would be within levels agreed upon last month in Paris by six major industrial nations. Finance ministers of Britain, Canada, France, Japan, the U.S. And West Germany agreed on February 22 to cooperate in stabilizing exchange rates around the current levels. The dollar had closed here at 153.77 yen on February 20. MIYAZAWA SAYS EXCHANGE RATES WILL STAY STABLE Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told a press conference he thinks exchange rates will remain stable due to the currency accord reached in Paris last month by six major industrialised nations but he did not say for how long.

Asked to comment on remarks by some U.S. Officials calling for a further decline of the dollar, Miyazawa said only the U.S. President and the U.S. Treasury Secretary can make official statements about exchange rates. U.K. MONEY MARKET GIVEN FURTHER 168 MLN STG HELP The Bank of England said it provided the money market with a further 168 mln stg of assistance to help offset a shortage it now estimated at 1.05 billion stg, revised down from 1.10 billion. It bought 21 mln stg of bank bills outright, 20 mln in band one at 10-3/8 pct and one mln in band two at 10-5/16 pct. In addition, it bought 98 mln stg of bills for resale on March 30 and 49 mln stg for resale April 8 at an interest rate of 10-7/16 pct. All these rates are the same as for today\\'s earlier help. So far today, the bank has provided the market with assistance worth 646 mln stg. The bank also announced the rates applicable to temporary lending facilities rolled over today. The average mid-market rate for lending rolled over for one week is 10-15/16 pct and for two weeks 10-5/8 pct. FED EXPECTED TO ADD TEMPORARY RESERVES The Federal Reserve is expected to enter the U.S. Government securities market to add temporary reserves, economists said. They expect it to supply the reserves indirectly by arranging a fairly large round, two billion dlrs or more, of customer repurchase agreements. The Fed may add the reserves directly instead via System repurchases. Federal funds, which averaged 6.02 pct on Friday, opened at 6-1/8 pct and traded between there and 6-1/16 pct. Funds are under upward pressure from settlement of recently sold two-year notes and from a Treasury tax and loan call on banks. UK MONEY MARKET DEFICIT REVISED TO ONE BILLION STG The Bank of England said it has revised its estimate of today\\'s shortfall to one billion stg, before taking account of 646 mln stg morning assistance. U.K. MONEY MARKET GIVEN FURTHER 195 MLN STG HELP The Bank of England said it provided the money market with a further 195 mln stg assistance during the afternoon. This brings total help today to 841 mln stg compared with a liquidity shortage it has estimated at a revised one billion stg. The Bank bought 176 mln stg of band two bank bills outright at 10-5/16 pct and 13 mln stg of band one bank bills at 10-3/8 pct. In addition, it bought four mln stg of bills for resale to the market on March 30 and two mln stg for resale on April 8, at a common interest rate of 10-7/16 pct. ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - EMS MARKS EIGHTH BIRTHDAY The European Monetary System marks its eighth anniversary still vulnerable to turmoil in world money markets despite creating an island of currency rate stability in Europe, economists say. But many economists say the system, which holds eight European Community currencies within narrow fluctuation bands, remains in its infancy. Its new currency, the European Currency Unit (Ecu), has been a runaway success with investors and borrowers alike seeking an alternative to the volatile dollar. And on Wednesday, the long term vision of the Ecu as Europe\\'s common currency took a step nearer to becoming reality when Belgium minted the world\\'s first Ecu coin. But economists say members such as West Germany have so far blocked a second stage of development envisaged by the system\\'s founding fathers, ex-West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt and former French President Valery Giscard d\\'Estaing. Under this phase, originally due to have started two years after the EMS was set up, decision-making was to have been transferred from national governments and central banks to an autonomous European Monetary Fund. But members have jealously guarded their sovereignty in economic and monetary matters. \"The basic problem of the EMS is that governments are not prepared to make the quantum leap to a situation where certain decisions are taken in common,\" said one economist who has closely watched the system\\'s development. The result is that the EC is often divided over policy on third currencies, accentuating what the economists say is the system\\'s greatest weakness, its vulnerability to a weak dollar. Over the past 18 months, as the U.S. Dollar plunged and investors moved into strong currencies, the resulting sharp rise of the West German mark severely strained the system. MORE As the mark soared against the dollar, it also rose against EMS currencies less favoured by international investors. And as West Germany last year refused to give in pressure from several EC partners and the United States to cut interest rates to slow the mark\\'s rise, the EMS had to be realigned twice to ease financial and trade strains within the community. Two months ago the mark and the Dutch guilder were revalued by three pct and the Belgian and Luxembourg francs by two pct against other currencies in the system -- the French franc, Italian lira, the Irish punt and Danish crown. Another frustration has been Britain\\'s failure to lend the EMS political support by keeping the pound, still a major world currency, outside the system. No change in the British government\\'s attitude is expected before the country\\'s next general elections, due by mid-1988. Meanwhile, the system\\'s last realignment, the 11th since it was set up, prompted European finance ministers to ask the EC\\'s highly-secretive Monetary Committee and Committee of Central Bank Governors to come up with suggestions for reinforcing it. Their ideas are due to be unveiled when finance ministers hold an informal meeting in Belgium early next month. But economists said the proposals are unlikely to involve more than tinkering with technical details. They are sceptical about the chances for any fundamental change. \"Technical measures won\\'t be enough to protect the EMS against external factors such as dollar weakness. For that we must take the step forward to the institutional level,\" said Leo de Corel of Kredietbank\\'s economic research department. Economists say the system\\'s fortunes now will depend largely on the success of an agreement last month among major industrial nations to stabilise exchange rates. If the dollar resumes its slide the EMS could be in for more turbulence, they predict. UK MONEY MARKET GIVEN LATE HELP OF 185 MLN STG The Bank of England said it gave the money market late, unspecified assistance of around 185 mln stg. This takes the total liquidity injected into the system by the bank today to 1.026 billion stg compared with a shortage it estimated at around one billion stg. Overnight interbank sterling dipped to 10 nine pct after the bank\\'s announcement compared with levels around 10-1/2 pct shortly before and 11-1/4 11 pct initially today, dealers said. FRANCE REPAYS SOME OF CURRENCY INTERVENTION DEBT France today repaid 21.95 billion francs of short-term currency intervention debt to the European Monetary Cooperation Fund, EMCF, the Finance Ministry said. It said the debt was part of a 33.90 billion franc liability incurred through the activation of EMCF swap facilities to defend the franc before the January 11 European Monetary System realignment. The realignment, following several weeks of speculative pressure, produced a three pct revaluation of the West German mark and the Dutch guilder against the French franc and a two pct revaluation of the Belgian franc. YEUTTER SAYS DLR LEVEL BASED ON ECONOMIC POLICY U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said that whether the exchange rate of the dollar would fall or rise in the coming decade would depend on nations\\' financial, monetary and tax policies. But, he said, in a speech and remarks to the Heritage Foundation, that in the end \"the marketplace will ultimately rule the day.\" Asked about the future of the dollar, he said that whether or not it would rise or fall depended on economic policies and coooperation among trading nations. Yeutter said \"if nations do the right kinds of things in financial, monetary and tax policies, then a lesser burden of adjustment is placed on exchange rates, and one could envision a situation of the major trading nations moving back far closer to what most of us would consider equilibrium and exchange rates becoming relatively stable.\" But he said, on the other hand, that if nations did not exhibit greater self discipline and international cooperation, \"It is simply inevitable that the exchange rates will make that adjustment.\" AFTER G-6, ROUND ONE GOES TO CENTRAL BANKS Central banks have easily beaten back the foreign exchange market\\'s first test of the industrialized nations\\' recent pact to stabilize currencies, analysts said. In active trading this week, the market pushed the dollar, sterling, the Canadian dollar and Australian dollar higher. But operators got their fingers burned as one by one the central banks signalled their displeasure. \"So far G-6 has been a roaring success,\"said James O\\'Neill, financial markets economist at Marine Midland Bank NA. \"The central banks are sending strong signals that they won\\'t tolerate any kind of momentum building behind currencies,\" added a senior corporate trader at one U.K. bank. On February 22, the finance ministers and central bank governors of the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France and the U.K. -- the Group of Five -- plus Canada, signed an accord under which they agreed to cooperate closely to foster stability of exchange rates around prevailing levels. The agreement was viewed by many in the market as an attempt to put a floor under the dollar after its sizeable two-year decline against major world currencies. And initially, traders indicated their respect for the accord by refraining from pushing the dollar lower. But by Wednesday, the dollar climbed to more than 1.87 marks, about five pfennigs above its levels the Friday before the G-6 accord. The move was aided by indications that the U.S. economy picked up steam in February at the same time as the West German economy was regressing. But dealers said the Federal Reserve Bank of New York gave traders a sharp reminder that the G-6 pact had encompassed the idea of limiting inordinate dollar gains as well as declines. Dealers differed as to whether the U.S. central bank actually intervened to sell dollars above 1.87 marks, or simply telephoned dealers to ask for quotes and enquire about trading conditions. But the dollar quickly backed off. It hovered today around 1.85 marks. \"The market was surprised that the Fed showed its face so soon,\" said Marine Midland NA\\'s O\\'Neill. Also on Wednesday, London dealers said the Bank of England intervened in the open market to sell sterling as the U.K. currency rose to 1.60 dlrs compared with 1.5355 dlrs before the G-6 pact. Sterling, along with the other high-yield currencies like the Australian dollar and Canadian dollar, was in favor after traders surmised that the the chance of intervention pursuant to the Paris currency accord left limited room for profit plays on dollar/mark and dollar/yen. The pound also was boosted by suggestions of an improving U.K. economy, anticipation of a popular British budget on March 17 and public opinion polls showing good chances for the incumbent Conservative party in any general election. \"There was a real run on sterling,\" said Anne Mills of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. Sterling traded today around 1.5750 dlrs, down from 1.5870 dlrs last night. It slid to 2.917 marks from 2.950 yesterday and from a peak of about 2.98 recently. \"There\\'s been some heavy profit-taking on sterling/mark ahead of next Tuesday\\'s U.K. budget,\" said James McGroarty of Discount Corp. As speculators detected the presence of the U.S. and British central banks, they acclerated their shift into Canadian and Australian dollars. But here too they were stymied. The Bank of Canada acted to slow its currency\\'s rise. The Canadian dollar traded at 1.3218/23 per U.S. dollar today, down from 1.3185/90 yesterday. And the Australian Reserve Bank, using the Fed as agent, sold Australian dollars in the U.S. yesterday, dealers said. The Australian dollar fell to a low of 67.45/55 U.S. cents today from a high of 69.02 Thursday. Analysts said the central banks\\' moves to stifle sudden upward movement, leave the market uncertain about its next step. Today, the focus shifted to the yen which has held to a very tight range against the dollar for several months. The dollar fell to 152.35/40 yen from 153.35/40 last night. Analysts said the yen also gained as traders unwound long sterling/short mark positions established lately. \"Because of the change in perceptions about the health of the German economy, the funds from those unwinding operations are ending up in yen,\" a dealer at one U.K. bank said. Recent West German data have shown falling industry orders, lower industrial output and slowing employment gains. Moreover, the yen is benefitting as Japanese entities who have invested heavily overseas, for example in Australian financial instruments, repatriate their profits ahead of the end of the Japanese fiscal year on March 31. Noting that the dollar/yen rate is in a sense the most controversial one because of the large U.S. trade deficit with Japan, analysts said the stage could be set for another test of the dollar\\'s downward scope against the Japanese currency. In its latest review of the foreign exchange market through the end of January, the Federal Reserve revealed that it intervened to protect the dollar against the yen on January 28. On that day, the dollar fell as low as 150.40 yen. \"Sure, the Fed bought dollars near the 150 yen level in January. But the market has to bear in mind that time marches on and the situation changes,\" said McGroarty of Discount. LEADING INDUSTRIAL NATIONS TO MEET IN APRIL Leading industrial nations will meet again next month to review their accord on currency stability, but U.S. Officials said financial markets are convinced for now the countries will live up to commitments to speed up economic growth. The narrow currency movements of recent weeks strongly suggests the six leading industrial countries have tamed the normally unruly financial markets and next month\\'s talks seem likely to build on that stability. A Reagan administration official said the Paris agreement last month was the main reason markets were calm. But he said in an interview that financial markets also understood, \"That all six countries concluded that the measures to be taken over a period of time in the future should foster stability of exchange rates around current levels. That is in fact what has happened since Paris.\" Monetary analysts said stability has been helped in part by the decision of industrial nations to bury the hatchet and cease to quarrel over short-term policy objectives. Instead they have focused on medium-term policy goals, but left room to adjust their agreements with periodic meetings. The official refused to comment, however, on whether the agreement included a secret pact to consider further coordinated interest rate cuts -- a measure industrial nations have taken jointly several times in the past year. On February 22, the United States, Japan, West Germany, France, Britain and Canada agreed that major currencies were within ranges broadly reflecting underlying economic conditions, given commitments by Washington to cut its budget deficit and by Toyko and Bonn to boost economic growth. The shake-up would strengthen the U.S. Position in future international talks. \"I think these changes will strengthen the President\\'s hand politically and the stronger he is politically the better off we are with the Congress and the better off we are in international fora,\" said the official, an Administration economic policymaker. \"So it would be beneficial to the continued conduct of our initiatives.\" But the official also said the Administration would resist calls for a tax increase to cut the budget deficit -- a target Europeans say is crucial to help curb economic instability. Last week, dealers said the Federal Reserve intervened to stop the dollar rising against the mark, which had breached 1.86 to the dollar. British authorities are also understood to have intervened to curb sterling\\'s strength. International monetary sources say finance ministers and central bankers, who will review market performance and their own economic prospects, will reassemble again in Washington just before the April 9 policymaking meeting of the International Monetary Fund. The sources said Italy, which refused to join the Paris pact, was invited back by Treasury Secretary James Baker. Since Paris, there are signs West German growth is slowing, while U.S. Officials said they were giving Japan until April to show that an economic stimulus package was in the offing. Signs of concern about German prospects emerged recently when Bundesbank (central bank) president Karl Otto Poehl told bankers he would consider cutting West German interest rates if the Fed was ready to follow suit. A Reagan Administration official said this would show there had been some change in approach on the part of the central bank in Germany. But he declined to comment on the prospects for action by the Fed and the Bundesbank. \"If there is such a provision it is private and if I talked about it, it would no longer be private,\" said the official, who asked not to be identified. Public comments by Fed officials suggest the central bank is keeping credit conditions broadly unchanged, but if the major economies continue to show sluggish growth and the U.S. Trade deficit remains stubbornly high, further coordinated action could be on the April agenda. REUTER... PERU BEGINS FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATIONING Peru will put into effect Monday a foreign exchange rationing system for imports designed to stop a slide in the country\\'s international reserves, a government decree in the Official Gazette said. Under the system, importers will be required to present a bill from the foreign seller of goods and apply for a license for foreign exchange. The central bank will have 10 days to decide whether to issue the required foreign exchange. Net international reserves now total about 800 mln dlrs compared to 1.54 billion dlrs a year ago. The system will be effective until the end of 1988. A ceiling for foreign exchange availability will be set by a council with members from the central bank, the economy ministry and the planning and foreign trade institutes. The central bank will issue licenses to procure foreign exchange in accordance with guidelines set by the council. Peru\\'s reserves fell sharply due to a drop in the trade surplus to about five mln dlrs in 1986 from 1.1 billion in 1985, according to preliminary central bank estimates. Total exports dropped to 2.50 billion dlrs last year against 2.97 billion in 1985. Imports last year rose sharply as gross domestic product grew by about 8.5 pct, the highest economic growth level registered in 12 years. Imports were about 2.49 billion dlrs in 1986 against 1.87 billion in 1985, according to preliminary estimates. The cushion of reserves allowed Peru to take a hard-line debt stance last year and suspend most payments due on its 14.3 billion dlr foreign debt. TAIWAN SAYS U.S. WANTS TAIWAN DOLLAR TO APPRECIATE The United States wants Taiwan\\'s currency to appreciate faster to reduce Taiwan\\'s trade surplus with the U.S., A senior trade official said. Board of Foreign Trade director Vincent Siew told reporters on Saturday U.S. Officials told him in Washington last week that unless Taiwan allowed its dollar to rise faster it would face retaliation. Siew returned from Washington on Friday after the U.S responded to Taiwan\\'s request to increase its textile export quotas by promising further talks in May. Taiwan\\'s surplus with the U.S. Hit a record 13.6 billion U.S. Dlrs in 1986. Washington signed a three-year accord with Taipei last year limiting textile export growth to 0.5 pct a year. Siew said the Taiwan dollar had risen by about 15 pct against the U.S. Dollar since September 1985. It surged last week amid indications Washington was seeking a major rise in its value. It rose four cents against the U.S. Dollar on Saturday to close at 34.59. Western trade sources told Reuters Taiwan and the U.S. Have been holding talks on the currency issue but added it is not clear how far Washington wants to see the Taiwan dollar rise. FED SETS 1.5 BILLION DLR CUSTOMER REPURCHASE, FED SAYS FED SETS 1.5 BILLION DLR CUSTOMER REPURCHASE, FED SAYS ZAMBIA, IMF TALKS HIT PROBLEMS OVER FOOD SUBSIDIES Zambia\\'s talks with the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) on a financial rescue package have run into difficulties on the issue of food subsidies, an official newspaper said. The Times of Zambia, which is run by the ruling United National Independence Party (UNIP), quoted official sources as saying the IMF and World Bank had refused to continue financing food subsidies and were pressing the government to explain how it proposes to pay for them. President Kenneth Kaunda tried to abolish maize subsidies last December, in line with IMF recommendations, but the move caused maize meal prices to double overnight and led to riots in which 15 people were killed. The subsidies were immediately restored as part of moves to quell the disturbances, but they are estimated to cost the government about 500 mln kwacha per year. The Times of Zambia said another major issue in the government\\'s current talks with the IMF and World Bank was the remodelling of Zambia\\'s foreign exchange auction. The central bank\\'s weekly auction of foreign exchange to the private sector has been suspended since the end of January, pending modifications to slow down the rate of devaluation and dampen fluctuations in the exchange rate. The kwacha slid to around 15 per dollar under the auction system, losing 85 pct of its value in 16 months. However, since the end of January it has been revalued to a fixed rate of nine per dollar. Banking sources said Zambia was persuaded by the World Bank and IMF to lift its proposed ceiling of 12.50 kwacha per dollar on the currency\\'s devaluation once the auctions restart. According to the Times of Zambia, the IMF team, led by assistant director for Africa Paul Acquah, is due to conclude its talks with the government on schedule on March 23. The IMF mission arrived in Lusaka on February 26 and its talks with the government have taken longer than expected. TREASURY, FOREIGN RESERVES ARE JORDAN\\'S PRIORITIES Jordan\\'s key economic priorities are having a sound national treasury and adequate foreign exchange reserves, Prime Minister Zeid al-Rifa\\'i said. \"First, the national treasury should be in sound shape when dealing with the public and other countries so that its credibility is preserved,\" he said in a television interview Saturday. \"The second priority is to maintain an acceptable level of foreign exchange reserves to provide (the) stability and confidence needed by the government to meet foreign commitments.\" Rifa\\'i said Jordan\\'s outstanding government-guaranteed and commercial loans total 902 mln dinars with a debt service ratio of 14.9 pct. The figure was sharply lower than the 1.02 billion dinars in outstanding loans at the end of September, according to latest Central Bank figures. Rifa\\'i dismissed the view of some bankers and economists here that the dinar, which is pegged to a basket of currencies, is overvalued. \"The dinar is strong and stable and we intend to preserve its stability,\" he said. The prime minister said he hoped the next Arab summit would tackle the question of continuing financial aid to Jordan. Under a 10-year agreement reached in 1978, Jordan was to receive a total of 1.25 billion dlrs annually from Algeria, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to help it resist Israel. But only Saudi Arabia met its obligations, while the others failed because of falling income due to lower oil prices. GERMAN BANKING AUTHORITIES WEIGH SWAP REGULATIONS German banking authorities are weighing rules for banks\\' off-balance sheet activities in an attempt to cope with the growing volume of sophisticated capital market instruments, banking sources said. Interest rate and currency swaps and currency options are under closest scrutiny, and if revisions are made they may resemble regulation jointly proposed by the U.S. And U.K. To Japan. Juergen Becker, director of the Bundesbank\\'s division of banking law and credit supervision, said the U.S.-British proposals were interesting, but declined to elaborate. But banking sources said West Germany was more likely to produce its own conclusions than to adopt foreign proposals. \"There is no formal plan yet, but talks are in the latter stages,\" one representative of the German Banking Association in Cologne said. Bankers expect rule changes this year. All alterations must be approved by the Bundesbank, West Germany\\'s four major banking associations and the Federal Banking Supervisory Office. Talks have been slowed by the fact that fundamental changes would require a revision of Germany\\'s credit law, which has been in effect since 1934. Authorities favour reinterpreting the credit law to fit present circumstances in order to avoid the long parliamentary political process of changing it, banking sources said. Since the beginning of 1984 the banking law has limited banks\\' lending to 18 times shareholders\\' equity plus reserves, on a consolidated basis. But lending ratios do not extend to several newer instruments such as spot and forward currency contracts, currency and interest swaps, commercial paper programs, currency options, interest rate futures in foreign currencies and various innovative types of interest rate hedges. The sources said the main value of the U.S.-U.K. Proposals lay in differentiating between different types of risk factor, and, for instance, in placing greater weight on currency swaps than interest swaps. But even if German banking authorities agree with some of the assessments of swaps, they disagree on how to find balance sheet equivalents for the risk. U.S.-British proposals include a complicated series of formulae for assessing the stream of payments involved in swaps, whose ultimate risk is borne by the financial intermediary, especially when counterparties remain anonymous. This is the so-called market-to-market value. But German authorities are likely to consider this much too complex and to base their evaluation instead on a schedule of lending ratings assigned according to the creditworthiness of the borrowers involved, the sources said. The weightings, also likely if lending ratios are extended to include banks\\' securities portfolios, are zero for public authorities, 20 pct for domestic banks, 50 pct for foreign banks and 100 pct for other foreign and non-bank borrowers. A further complication is that the more flexible definitions of equity allowed in the U.S. And the U.K. May put German banks at a competitive disadvantage, the sources said. Stricter definitions here also mean the use of a version of the U.S.-U.K. Proposals could far exceed the intent of the U.S. And British authorities, the sources said. One specialist for Dresdner Bank AG said a long-dated foreign exchange forward transaction could, for instance, be brought under the same rule as a cross-currency swap, despite the fact that the risk may be entirely different. How new regulations will affect foreign banks here was uncertain. Many have converted to full subsidiary status and applied for a full banking licence over the last two years in order to lead-manage mark eurobonds. But as their equity capital is fairly small, tight lending ratios will severely hamper foreign banks\\' freedom of movement, particularly in the growing business of currency swaps, if they are required to include more transactions in the balance sheet, the sources added. Bank of Japan satisfied with yen around current range, senior bank official says Bank of Japan satisfied with yen around current range, senior bank official says BANK OF JAPAN SATISFIED WITH YEN AT CURRENT RANGE The Bank of Japan is satisfied with the yen around its current range, a senior central bank official told reporters. He said the pledge by major industrial nations in Paris last month to cooperate to hold exchange rates around current ranges applied in both directions, a dollar fall or a dollar rise. Unilateral intervention itself cannot ensure currency stability, but it can be useful when coordinated with other policies and with other central banks, he said. The Bank of Japan is rather confident currency stability will continue for some time, the senior bank official said, but declined to be more specific. Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told parliament on Friday the current dollar/yen exchange rate is not necessarily satisfactory for the Japanese economy. Asked what factors might destabilize the markets, the official cited a lessening of market fear about intervention, a completely unexpected change in the economy of Japan, the U.S. Or West Germany, or resumption of comments by government officials seeking to talk the dollar up or down. The senior bank official said he expects Japan\\'s gross national product (GNP) to grow three pct or slightly more in the fiscal year beginning in April. That would be little changed from the performance expected this year. Domestic demand may grow nearly four pct in 1987/88, but the external sector will have a negative impact on GNP of nearly one percentage point, he said. He said there was virtually no room for further monetary policy action to boost the economy. The economy\\'s performance in the future very much depends on fiscal policy, he added. The central bank\\'s monetary policy has already done its part in stimulating the economy, the senior bank official said. The Bank of Japan has cut its discount rate five times over the last year and a half. Although the central bank does not see any imminent risk of inflation, there could be some problems in the future, he said. \"We are sitting on a barrel of powder, but fortunately it may still be wet,\" he added. Liquidity among private households and especially the corporate sector has increased substantially, he said. The liquidity is the reason for the recent boom of stock exchange prices, the bank official said. This inflow of funds into the stock exchange, occurring also in other countries, may continue, he said. The senior official said the Bank of Japan is hoping Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker will be re-appointed when his current term expires later this year. \"He\\'s a great man,\" the official said, adding that more and more people expect his reappointment. Turning to exchange rates, the official said the substantial drop in the dollar is beginning to have an effect on reducing the imbalance in world trade, even though the impact has taken longer than expected to show through. Even the U.S. Trade position has begun to feel the impact, although so far it has not been very strong, he said. FED ADDS RESERVES VIA CUSTOMER REPURCHASES The Federal Reserve entered the U.S. Government securities market to arrange 1.5 billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreements, a Fed spokesman said. Dealers said Federal funds were trading at 6-3/16 pct when the Fed began its temporary and indirect supply of reserves to the banking system. U.K. MONEY MARKET OFFERED EARLY ASSISTANCE The Bank of England said it invited an early round of bill offers from discount houses after forecasting a shortage in the system of some 1.05 billion stg. Among the main factors affecting liquidity, bills maturing in official hands and treasury bill take-up will drain some 1.07 billion stg while exchequer transactions will take out around 335 mln stg and bankers\\' balances below target five mln stg. Partly offseting these outflows, a fall in note circulation will add some 355 mln stg to the system today. U.K. MONEY MARKET GIVEN 90 MLN STG EARLY HELP The Bank of England said it provided the money market with assistance worth 90 mln stg in response to an early round of bill offers from discount houses. Earlier, the bank estimated the shortage in the system today at some 1.05 billion stg. The bank bought bills for resale to the market in equal amounts on April 1, 2 and 3 at an interest rate of 10-7/16 pct. BUNDESBANK ADDS MONEY MARKET LIQUIDITY The Bundesbank came into the domestic money market to add temporary liquidity through federal government funds as call money rates rose above 4.0 pct, dealers said. They estimated that the bulk of liquidity was added at about 3.95 pct. Call money fell to 3.90/4.0 pct after the move. It had been 3.80/90 on Friday. The move came as call money extended a rise begun Friday after the Bundesbank took up some six billion marks owed to it by other European central banks after currency interventions in the framework of European Monetary System in January. Rates could ease further in trading today but dealers expect them to rise later in the week as banks begin paying out funds for tax payments on behalf of clients. Some 30 billion marks is likely to leave the market this month, with the bulk being paid out next week. In anticipation of this liquidity drain, banks have stocked up reserves at the Bundesbank. On Thursday, minimum reserve holdings declined to 57.0 billion marks from 60.0 billion on Wednesday but were well above the 53.2 billion held on Tuesday. Daily average reserve holdings rose slightly to 54.7 billion marks from 54.5 billion. The daily average reserve holdings were above the level of around 51 billion marks dealers said is needed for the required daily average for the month. With the heavy tax drain in March, banks are likely to remain cautious about taking more liquidity out of reserves than is absolutely necessary. However, a new securities repurchase pact likely to be added next week to replace a facility expiring then could somewhat offset the drain. The Bundesbank is expected to allocate more than the 3.4 billion marks which is due to be rolled over, dealers said. U.K. MONEY MARKET DEFICIT FORECAST REVISED UPWARDS The Bank of England said it had revised its estimate of the shortage in the money market today up to 1.15 billion stg before taking account of its early operations. Earlier, the bank forecast the deficit at 1.05 billion stg and gave 90 mln stg assistance at an early round of bill offers. BANK OF JAPAN SATISFIED WITH YEN AT CURRENT RANGE The Bank of Japan is satisfied with the yen around its current range, a senior central bank official told reporters.

This inflow of funds into the stock exchange, occurring also in other countries, may continue, he said. U.K. MONEY MARKET GIVEN FURTHER 30 MLN STG HELP The Bank of England said it provided the money market with a further 30 mln stg assistance. This brings the Bank\\'s total help so far today to 120 mln stg and compares with its upward revised estimate that the system would face a shortage of some 1.15 billon stg. The central bank bought bills for resale to the market in equal amounts on April 1, 2 and 3 at an interest rate of 10-7/16 pct. PERU BEGINS FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATIONING Peru will put into effect today a foreign exchange rationing system for imports designed to stop a slide in the country\\'s international reserves, a government decree in the Official Gazette said.

A ceiling for foreign exchange availability will be set by a council with members from the central bank, the economy ministry and the planning and foreign trade institutes.

Peru\\'s reserves fell sharply due to a drop in the trade surplus to about five mln dlrs in 1986 from 1.1 billion in 1985, according to preliminary central bank estimates. Total exports dropped to 2.50 billion dlrs last year against 2.97 billion in 1985.

Currency analysts believe the Paris agreement set secret short-term target ranges for their currencies with a specific agreement to defend those bands with intervention. According to market sources, the ranges agreed were 1.60 to 1.90 marks to the dollar, and 140 to 155 yen to the dollar. There is no official confirmation that specific bands  were set, although the agreement used the term \"ranges\", for the first time in an international economic agreement. The Paris accord stated the six would cooperate closely to foster currency stability around current levels. Last week, dealers said the Federal Reserve intervened to stop the dollar rising against the mark, which had breached 1.86 to the dollar.

The Times of Zambia, which is run by the ruling United National Independence Party (UNIP), quoted official sources as saying the IMF and World Bank had refused to continue financing food subsidies and were pressing the government to explain how it proposes to pay for them. President Kenneth Kaunda tried to abolish maize subsidies last December, in line with IMF recommendations, but the move caused maize meal prices to double overnight and led to riots. The subsidies were immediately restored as part of moves to quell the disturbances. The Times of Zambia said another major issue in the government\\'s current talks with the IMF and World Bank was the remodelling of Zambia\\'s foreign exchange auction. The central bank\\'s weekly auction of foreign exchange to the private sector has been suspended since the end of January, pending modifications to slow down the rate of devaluation and dampen fluctuations in the exchange rate. The kwacha slid to around 15 per dollar under the auction, losing 85 pct of its value in 16 months, but since the end of January has been revalued to a fixed rate of nine per dollar. Banking sources said Zambia was persuaded by the World Bank and IMF to lift its proposed ceiling of 12.50 kwacha per dollar on the currency\\'s devaluation once the auctions restart. BANK OF FRANCE LEAVES MONEY MARKET INTERVENTION RATE UNCHANGED AT 7-3/4 PCT - OFFICIAL BANK OF FRANCE LEAVES MONEY MARKET INTERVENTION RATE UNCHANGED AT 7-3/4 PCT - OFFICIAL U.K. MONEY MARKET GIVEN 550 MLN STG LATE HELP The Bank of England said it provided the money market with late assistance of around 550 mln stg. This takes the Bank\\'s total help today to some 1.12 billion stg and compares with its estimated deficit of around 1.10 billion. ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - EMS MARKS EIGHTH BIRTHDAY The European Monetary System marks its eighth anniversary still vulnerable to turmoil in world money markets despite creating an island of currency rate stability in Europe, economists say. But many economists say the system, which holds eight European Community currencies within narrow fluctuation bands, remains in its infancy. Its new currency, the European Currency Unit (Ecu), has been a runaway success with investors and borrowers alike seeking an alternative to the volatile dollar. And on Wednesday, the long term vision of the Ecu as Europe\\'s common currency took a step nearer to becoming reality when Belgium minted the world\\'s first Ecu coin. But economists say members such as West Germany have so far blocked a second stage of development envisaged by the system\\'s founding fathers, ex-West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt and former French President Valery Giscard d\\'Estaing. Under this phase, originally due to have started two years after the EMS was set up, decision-making was to have been transferred from national governments and central banks to an autonomous European Monetary Fund. But members have jealously guarded their sovereignty in economic and monetary matters. \"The basic problem of the EMS is that governments are not prepared to make the quantum leap to a situation where certain decisions are taken in common,\" said one economist who has closely watched the system\\'s development. The result is that the EC is often divided over policy on third currencies, accentuating what the economists say is the system\\'s greatest weakness, its vulnerability to a weak dollar. Over the past 18 months, as the U.S. Dollar plunged and investors moved into strong currencies, the resulting sharp rise of the West German mark severely strained the system. Another frustration has been Britain\\'s failure to lend the EMS political support by keeping the pound, still a major world currency, outside the system. No change in the British government\\'s attitude is expected before the country\\'s next general elections, due by mid-1988. Meanwhile, the system\\'s last realignment, the 11th since it was set up, prompted European finance ministers to ask the EC\\'s highly-secretive Monetary Committee and Committee of Central Bank Governors to come up with suggestions for reinforcing it. Their ideas are due to be unveiled when finance ministers hold an informal meeting in Belgium early next month. But economists said the proposals are unlikely to involve more than tinkering with technical details. They are sceptical about the chances for any fundamental change. \"Technical measures won\\'t be enough to protect the EMS against external factors such as dollar weakness. For that we must take the step forward to the institutional level,\" said Leo de Corel of Kredietbank\\'s economic research department. Economists say the system\\'s fortunes now will depend largely on the success of an agreement last month among major industrial nations to stabilise exchange rates. If the dollar resumes its slide the EMS could be in for more turbulence, they predict. FED EXPECTED TO SET CUSTOMER REPURCHASES The Federal Reserve is expected to intervene in the government securities market to add reserves via two to 2.5 billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreements, economists said. Economists said the Fed will inject temporary reserves indirectly to offset pressure on the Federal funds rate associated with quarterly corporate tax payments to the Treasury department. Fed funds opened at 6-1/4 pct and remained at that level late this morning. Friday funds averaged 6.05 pct. SPAIN TO RELAX EXCHANGE CONTROLS The Bank of Spain is relaxing exchange controls to help put Spanish banks on an equal footing with European Community competitors by the 1993 deadline for the ending of restrictions, a central bank spokesman said. \"The measures to take effect by June were designed to lift restrictions on foreign currency operations, in line with deregulation in the banking industry,\" he said in a telephone interview. The spokesman said the relaxation of exchange controls highlighted a broader package of reforms announced last Friday. The central bank said in a statement the measures included increased provisions for high-risk borrowers and a provision for future pension fund obligations. It said the measures were the latest steps to deregulate Spain\\'s financial sector, a move triggered by entry into the Community last year. Spain has five years to complete bank deregulation, a process that began in 1978 when the government allowed foreign banks to open branches. Since then 39 foreign banks have come into the market and they now control about 15 pct of the system\\'s lending assets. Residents in Spain can now borrow freely in foreign currency up to the equivalent of 1.5 billion pesetas against a previous ceiling of 750 mln pesetas. The 750 mln peseta limit was set last March. Between that date and the end of last year some 430 mln dlrs flowed into the country on new foreign currency loans. The central bank spokesman said operations over 1.5 billion pesetas were technically subject to authorisation, but would be given clearance if the government failed to act in 15 days. Spanish banks will also be allowed to expand their foreign currency funding, formerly obtainable through deposits, by issuing certificates of deposit, bonds and commercial paper. They can also employ these funds to invest in foreign issues, while before they had to be converted into deposits. Foreign exchange operations can be in mixed currencies, instead of having to borrow and lend in the same currency. The central bank has also lifted the restriction on the amount of foreign exchange loans, which previously were limited to three times a bank\\'s capital equity. The latest deregulation measures were welcomed by most bankers, in contrast to rulings issued earlier this month which imposed a 19 pct reserve requirement on new convertible peseta funds held by banks and freed short term deposit rates. The reserve requirement, which was already in place on normal peseta deposits, was intended to curb short-term foreign speculative capital which is entering the country and threatening the government\\'s money supply growth target. A foreign banker said high reserve requirements, which now account for about 30 pct of deposits, placed Spanish banks at a disadvantage with European competitors. The government reduced fixed asset investment requirements to 11 pct from 23 pct to help offset the negative impact of interest rate deregulation. \"The real problem is the freeing of interest rates,\" the banker said. \"This is going to take a big bite out of profits.\" The ruling lifted a six pct ceiling on interest rates paid on deposits of up to 180 days. The chairman of one of Spain\\'s leading banks said the measure was expected to bring a 20 pct drop in profits this year. FED SAYS IT SETS THREE-DAY SYSTEM REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS FED SAYS IT SETS THREE-DAY SYSTEM REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS FED ADDS RESERVES VIA THREE-DAY REPURCHASES The Federal Reserve entered the U.S. Government securities market to arrange three-day System repurchase agreements, a Fed spokesman said. Dealers said that Federal funds were trading at 6-1/4 pct when the Fed began its temporary and direct supply of reserves to the banking system. DOLLAR SEEN FALLING UNLESS JAPAN SPURS ECONOMY Underlying dollar sentiment is bearish, and operators may push the currency to a new low unless Japan takes steps to stimulate its economy as pledged in the Paris accord, foreign exchange analysts polled by Reuters said here. \"The dollar is expected to try its psychological barrier of 150.00 yen and to fall even below that level,\" a senior dealer at one leading bank said. The dollar has eased this week, but remains stable at around 151.50 yen. Six major industrial countries agreed at a meeting in Paris in February to foster currency stability. Some dealers said the dollar may decline in the long term, but a drastic fall is unlikely because of U.S. Fears of renewed inflation and fears of reduced Japanese purchases of U.S. Treasury securities, needed to finance the U.S. Deficit. Dealers generally doubted whether any economic package Japan could adopt soon would be effective enough to reduce its trade surplus significantly, and said such measures would probably invite further U.S. Steps to weaken the dollar. Under the Paris accord, Tokyo promised a package of measures after the fiscal 1987 budget was passed to boost domestic demand, increase imports and cut its trade surplus. But debate on the budget has been delayed by an opposition boycott of Parliamentary business over the proposed imposition of a five pct sales tax, and the government has only a slim chance of producing a meaningful economic package in the near future, the dealers said. If no such steps are taken, protectionist sentiment in the U.S. Congress will grow, putting greater downward pressure on the dollar, they said. The factors affecting the U.S. Currency have not changed since before the Paris accord, they added. \"Underlying sentiment for the dollar remains bearish due to a still-sluggish U.S. Economic outlook, the international debt crisis triggered by Brazil\\'s unilateral suspension of interest payments on its foreign debts and the reduced clout of the Reagan administration as a result of the Iran/Contra arms scandal,\" said a senior dealer at a leading trust bank. \"There is a possibility that the dollar may decline to around 140.00 yen by the end of this year,\" said Chemical Bank Tokyo branch vice president Yukuo Takahashi. But operators find it hard to push the dollar either way for fear of possible concerted central bank intervention. Dealers said there were widespread rumours that the U.S. Federal Reserve telephoned some banks in New York to ask for quotes last Wednesday, and even intervened to sell the dollar when it rose to 1.87 marks. The Bank of England also apparently sold sterling in London when it neared 1.60 dlrs on Wednesday, they said. But other dealers said they doubted the efficacy of central bank intervention, saying it may stimulate the dollar\\'s decline because many dealers are likely to await such dollar buying intervention as a chance to sell dollars. However, First National Bank of Chicago Tokyo Branch assistant manager Hiroshi Mochizuki said \"The dollar will not show drastic movement at least to the end of March.\" Other dealers said the U.S. Seems unwilling to see any strong dollar swing until Japanese companies close their books for the fiscal year ending on March 31, because a weak dollar would give Japanese institutional investors paper losses on their foreign holdings, which could make them lose interest in purchases of U.S. Treasury securities. U.S. Monetary officials may refrain from making any comments this month to avoid influencing rates, they said. MARKET WELCOMES LOWER AUSTRALIAN PAYMENTS DEFICIT The Australian dollar rose more than 40 points and money market interest rates retreated on the better than expected improvement in the February current account deficit, but economists and dealers were cautious about identifying it as the start of a downward trend. The current account deficit narrowed to 750 mln dlrs in February from 1.23 billion in January. It hit 13.82 billion dlrs in 1985/86 to end-June. The currency jumped to 0.6858/63 U.S. Dlrs and traded as high as 0.6875 before retreating to around 0.6864/69. \"It\\'s got 69 cents written all over it,\" one dealer said. Foreign exchange dealers said some buyers had gone long on the dollar expecting a lower figure and sold it down about 30 points to 0.6820 U.S. Dlrs before the release. The 750 mln dlr deficit was at the lower end of forecasts and analysts said the market would welcome any figure below one billion dlrs for March. Banque National de Paris &lt;BNPP.A> senior dealer Peter Nicolls cautioned that in the long term the currency and interest rates were too high for import substitution and export industries. Nicolls said he expected the dollar to go as high as 0.6875 and perhaps to 69 cents tomorrow. &lt;Lloyds Bank NZA Ltd> chief economist Will Buttrose said the 42 mln dlr trade surplus was encouraging as were imports at 2.77 billion dlrs, down from 2.99 billion in January. But he warned that the outlook for rural and iron and coal exports remained poor. \"We should remember we are paying something like seven to eight billion dollars simply to service our foreign debt and that is not going to go away in the near term,\" Buttrose said. Buttrose said he expected a March deficit of around 900 mln dlrs, and added \"Any figure under a billion dollars will be acceptable (to the markets).\" ANZ Banking Group Ltd &lt;ANZA.S> senior economist Ian Little said the big question was whether the improvement in exports could be sustained. February FOB exports rose to 2.82 billion dlrs from a revised 2.74 billion in January. Interest rates responded quickly to the deficit news, with 90-day bank bill yields falling to 16.42-16.45 pct from early highs of 16.50 and yields yesterday as high as 16.65. Longer term yields fell with 10-year bonds at 13.66/68 pct from 13.74 before the release and highs of 13.87 yesterday. The stock market was easier at midsession but brokers said the current account data had little impact on trading. AUSTRALIAN CURRENCY TRADING SET RECORD IN JANUARY Spot volume in the Australian foreign exchange market jumped to a record 22.63 billion dlrs a day in January from 16.18 billion in December and 8.27 billion a year earlier, the Reserve Bank said in its monthly bulletin. The previous record was 17.51 billion dlrs last August. The peak broke a steady trading trend of 15 to 17 billion dlrs a day seen in the second half of 1986. Including forward deals, total deliverable volume was 27.01 billion dlrs a day (13.43 billion against the Australian dollar) against 19.56 billion (8.48 billion) in December and 9.92 billion (5.88 billion) a year earlier, the bank said. Danish central bank cuts overnight money market interest rate to 10.5 pct from 11 pct - official Danish central bank cuts overnight money market interest rate to 10.5 pct from 11 pct - official U.K. MONEY MARKET DEFICIT FORECAST AT 450 MLN STG The Bank of England said it forecast a shortage of around 450 mln stg in the money market today. Among the main factors affecting liquidity, bills maturing in official hands and the take-up of treasury bills will drain some 650 mln stg while banker\\'s balances below target will take out around 50 mln stg. Partly offsetting these outflows, exchequer transactions and a fall in note circulation will add some 200 mln stg and 50 mln stg to the system respectively. TAIWAN SAID CONSIDERING CURRENCY LIBERALISATION Taiwan\\'s central bank is considering proposals to ease currency restrictions to reduce foreign exchange reserves of 51 billion U.S. Dlrs, a local newspaper reported today. The China Times, which has close ties with the government, quoted central bank governor Chang Chi-cheng as saying the government had agreed in principle to liberalise financial restrictions. The bank was considering proposals to allow firms and individuals to hold foreign exchange and invest in foreign stocks for the first time, Chang was quoted as saying. All foreign exchange must now be handed to local banks and exchanged for local currency. Firms and individuals may only invest in foreign government bonds, treasury bills and certificates of deposit. Central bank and other government officials were not available to comment on the report. Economists said it was likely that the government would ease foreign exchange controls, but only gradually. They said vast foreign currency reserves, earned mainly from huge trade surpluses with the United States, made Taiwan a target for U.S. Protectionism. Taiwan\\'s trade surplus with the U.S. Rose to 13.6 billion U.S. Dlrs last year compared with 10.2 billion in 1985. \"The central bank has to go in this direction,\" said Su Han-min, chief economist with the International Commercial Bank of China. \"If they don\\'t quicken the pace, Washington could retaliate and really damage Taiwan.\" DOLLAR SEEN FALLING UNLESS JAPAN SPURS ECONOMY Underlying dollar sentiment is bearish, and operators may push the currency to a new low unless Japan takes steps to stimulate its economy as pledged in the Paris accord, foreign exchange analysts polled by Reuters said here. \"The dollar is expected to try its psychological barrier of 150.00 yen and to fall even below that level,\" a senior dealer at one leading bank said.

U.K. MONEY MARKET RECEIVES NO MORNING ASSISTANCE The Bank of England said it did not operate in the money market in the morning session. Earlier, the central bank had estimated the deficit in the system today at some 450 mln stg. U.K. MONEY MARKET SHORTAGE FORECAST REVISED DOWN The Bank of England said it had revised its forecast of the shortage in the money market today down to 400 mln stg from 450 mln stg. U.K. MONEY MARKET RECEIVES 16 MLN STG ASSISTANCE The Bank of England said it had provided the money market with 16 mln stg help in the afternoon session. The Bank did not operate in the market in the morning and earlier revised its estimate of the shortage in the system today down to 400 mln stg from 450 mln. The central bank purchased bills outright in band one at 10-3/8 pct comprising two mln stg of local authority bills and 14 mln stg of bank bills. U.K. MONEY MARKET GIVEN 120 MLN STG LATE HELP The Bank of England said it provided the money market with late assistance of around 120 mln stg. This brings the bank\\'s total help today to some 136 mln stg and compares with its forecast of a 400 mln stg shortage in the system. FED MAY SUPPLY RESERVES IN THE MONEY MARKETS There is a slightly better than even chance that the Federal Reserve will enter the U.S. Government securities market to add temporary reserves, economists said. They said the Fed would supply the reserves indirectly via around 1.5 billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreements. Federal funds, which averaged 6.25 pct yesterday, opened at 6-1/16 pct and moved in a narrow range between there and six pct in early trading. FED SETS TWO BILLION DLR CUSTOMER REPURCHASE, FED SAYS FED SETS TWO BILLION DLR CUSTOMER REPURCHASE, FED SAYS FED ADDS RESERVES VIA CUSTOMER REPURCHASES The Federal Reserve entered the U.S. Government securities market to arrange two billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreements, a Fed spokesman said. Dealers said Federal funds were trading at 6-1/16 pct when the Fed began its temporary and indirect supply of reserves to the banking system. ZAMBIAN EXCHANGE AUCTION TO RESUME AT END OF MARCH Zambia will reintroduce a modified foreign exchange auction at the end of this month as part of a new two-tier exchange rate, central bank governor Leonard Chivuno said. Chivuno told a press conference at the end of three weeks of negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) that there would be a fixed exchange rate for official transactions and a fluctuating rate, decided by the auction, for other types of business. The Bank of Zambia previously held weekly auctions to distribute foreign exchange to the private sector and determine the kwacha\\'s exchange rate, but these were suspended at the end of January. President Kenneth Kaunda said at the time that he was suspending the auction system in view of the rapid devaluation and violent fluctations of the exchange rate which had resulted. Business and banking sources said another reason for suspending the auction was that the central bank was low on foreign exchange and was 10 weeks behind in paying successful bidders.    The kwacha stood at 2.2 per dollar when the auction system was first introduced in October 1985, but it slid to around 15 per dollar by the time it was suspended 16 months later. Since then, Zambia has operated a fixed exchange rate of about nine kwacha per dollar. DOLLAR VALUE APPROPRIATE, BUNDESBANK OFFICIAL SAYS The dollar is near appropriate levels against European currencies and the yen, and a further fall could damage confidence in the currency while endangering world economic growth, a top Bundesbank official said. Board member Leonhard Gleske also told a Forex Association conference current exchange rates of major currencies \"can be viewed as equilibrium levels in a medium-term perspective.\" He said the recent Paris agreement on currency stabilisation and policy coordination between the Group of Five and Canada may herald \"an era of greater exchange rate stability.\" The Paris agreement was not, however, an attempt to set up permanent target zones for exchange rates, Gleske stressed, adding such targets would be extremely difficult to agree and enforce on an international level. \"At present levels the dollar can no longer be considered grossly overvalued in relation to the European currencies and the yen,\" Gleske said. He said the dollar had fallen much less against currencies of important trading nations such as Canada, Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong, and further falls there may still be necessary. But \"a further dollar depreciation against major European currencies and the yen may not be the best way to restore the dollar to a fully competitive position, as measured by its weighted external value,\" he said. In fact, a further marked decline in the dollar rate would hold two major dangers, Gleske said. First, in countries with large balance of payments surpluses such as Japan and West Germany, it threatened to hamper economic growth and thus slow down the expansion of real income and domestic expenditure necessary to wipe out surpluses. Second, in the United States, it could damage investors\\' confidence in the dollar and thus reduce their willingness to finance huge fiscal and external payments deficits, Gleske said. Gleske also was strongly sceptical that an international system of binding target zones for currencies, fluctuating in narrow bands against each other, can be established. Such targets threatened to cause policy conflicts, \"both within countries and between them.\" For instance, the U.S. Reliance on foreign capital to fund its deficits requires interest rates there be set at high levels, but domestic considerations call for low ones. If target zones were established, this would put \"pressure on other countries to reduce their interest rates even more, even though this may be in conflict with their own domestic situation and priorities,\" he said. Gleske added, \"targeting the exchange rate even within a wide margin will meet with serious objections where there is a clearly perceived potential for conflict between domestic and external policy priorities.\" Commenting on the Paris currency accord, Gleske said its chances of stabilising exchange rates rested heavily on current interest rate differentials being maintained. These chances \"seem to me to rest critically on the expectation that the current configuration of interest rates, and the monetary policies behind them, will assure smooth financing of current account imbalances in the months ahead.\" Gleske said past experience of currency adjustments had learned \"that markets are inclined to be impatient and will thus tend to overshoot.\" He said this \"would seem to be unnecessary and should be avoided if at all possible.\" Monetary policies can help achieve this, but only if markets believe that pledged changes in fiscal policies will lead to balanced international payments, he said. GULF ARAB MINISTERS DISCUSS ECONOMIC COOPERATION Finance and economy ministers of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) opened a two- day meeting to discuss further economic integration, officials said. They said issues to be discussed by the ministers from Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) would include a recommendation by central bank governors on a common currency exchange rate. The governors agreed in January on a denominator on which to base currencies of the six states. Any decision will be forwarded for final approval to a GCC summit meeting due in Saudi Arabia late this year. The six states have different currency systems. Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar and the UAE are linked in theory to the International Monetary Fund\\'s basket of currencies -- the special drawing right (SDR) -- but in practice to the dollar. Oman links its currency formally to the dollar, while Kuwait pegs its dinar to a trade-weighted basket devised by itself. The denominator chosen by central bank governors has not been disclosed, but some bankers expect the currencies to be linked to the SDR or a trade-weighted basket. Opening the meeting, Ahmed al-Tayer, the UAE\\'s Minister of State for Finance and Industry, said implementation of joint economic agreements \"is increasingly linking the interests of GCC citizens together.\" The general assembly of the Gulf Investment Corporation met in Abu Dhabi earlier under the chairmanship of Bahrain\\'s Finance and National Economy Minister, Ibrahim Abdul-Karim The corporation was formed to contribute to joint economic and investment projects in the GCC. Officials said the corporation\\'s assets rose to 1.31 billion dollars last year from 1.04 billion at the end of 1985. YEN USURPS GODZILLA AS JAPAN\\'S FAVOURITE HORROR \"Endaka,\" the strong yen, has usurped \"Godzilla Versus the Sea Monster\" as Japan\\'s favourite horror story. The yen\\'s 40 pct surge against the dollar over the last two years has frightened foreigners with tales of the 40 dlr melon, the 120 dlr taxi ride from the airport and rents of 15,000 dlrs a month. But \"endaka,\" like many Japanese products, is for foreign consumption, locals and long-time foreign residents said. \"It\\'s not really that expensive. I don\\'t pay attention to the cost of living,\" said Cheryl Richmond, a 25-year-old Canadian teacher of English in Tokyo. Richmond said she earns 1,635 dlrs a month by \"chatting\" 40 hours a week in English to Japanese who hope to learn the language. For 326 dlrs a month she rents a sunny, quiet two-room flat some 20 minutes by train from Shinjuku, one of Tokyo\\'s prime business and entertainment districts, and has managed to send home an average of 320 dlrs a month. She spends less than 6.50 dlrs a day on food despite eating out once a day. \"For lunch I buy the teishoku (daily special) which comes with soba (buckwheat noodles) or pork cutlet, pickles, miso soup, rice and tea,\" although she takes only coffee for breakfast and a sandwich for dinner. No one argues that Tokyo is cheap, but long-time residents see no need to spend the 2,000 to 15,000 dlrs a month spent by foreign firms to house executives in Western-style homes. The companies feel otherwise. They say they must pay the price to bring over the best people needed to back up their push into Japan\\'s increasingly lucrative markets. \"You can\\'t expect people to move from New York or Sydney and trade down. It\\'s not reasonable,\" said a spokesman for International Business Machines Corp (IBM), which supports Western lifestyles for more than 350 foreigners in Tokyo. Tokyo is the world\\'s most expensive city for business travellers, a survey issued this month by Employment Conditions Abroad said. It found that businessmen visiting Tokyo spend on average more than 300 dlrs a day. While the businessmen have little choice but to come here, many tourists, especially those from Europe, are opting to visit sunnier and cheaper climes in Southeast Asia. The Japan Tourist Bureau estimates \"endaka\" caused an 11.5 pct drop in the number of foreign visitors to Japan last year. Those who came tried to cut back on expenses, chiefly by curtailing shopping, it said. To help combat \"endaka\" and the slump in tourism, the Tourist Bureau prepared a pamphlet, \"Economical Travel in Japan.\" It gives budget-saving tips on finding medium-priced business hotels and Japanese-style inns, cheap sushi and public baths while getting a \"revealing glimpse of Japanese in their daily lives.\" Residents of Okubo House, a transit hotel in Tokyo\\'s Shin-Okubo love hotel district, offer even more savvy advice. For 9.80 dlrs a night, Scott Perry, a 23-year-old budding English teacher from New Zealand, shares an unheated, berth-sized twin-room in the Japanese \"flop house.\" Perry has budgeted 26 to 33 dlrs a day while he looks for work. \"Normally I eat \\'teishoku\\' for 400 yen but sometimes I\\'ll splurge at Shakey\\'s where for 550 yen you can eat unlimited pizza for at least two hours.\" Still, there are the extras that dent the budget. \"I had to spend 600 yen today to dry-clean my suit coat,\" he said. GLOBAL TRADING IN YEN BOND FUTURES EXPECTED SOON Global trading of yen bond futures is just around the corner and they are expected to be listed soon on the London International Financial Futures Exchange (LIFFE) and the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT), bond managers said. \"Internationalisation of the yen through expansion of overseas portfolios in yen assets is the key to the success of global trading of yen bond futures,\" said Katsuyuki Okayasu, general manager of Yamaichi Securities Co Ltd\\'s bond division. \"But Tokyo-based orders are necessary for a primary stimulus for the LIFFE yen bond futures market,\" said Tetsuya Dezuka, deputy general manager of the money market section of New Japan Securities Co Ltd, one of the most active yen bond brokers in London. Healthy growth of yen bond futures markets depends basically on substantial liquidity in cash yen bond markets overseas and on the yen becoming attractive to traders there, dealers said. Outstanding yen cash bonds worldwide stand at around 140,000 billion yen, with most held in Japan, they said. An agreement between CBOT and LIFFE in early February on mutual settlements is expected to link U.S. Treasury bond futures trading in London and Chicago, enabling a continuous 12-hour session, bond managers here said, adding the move was made with yen bond futures trading in mind. LIFFE is preparing for an early listing of yen bond futures after receiving approval from Japan\\'s Finance Ministry last December. But futures markets will never take root unless they are backed by substantial liquidity in cash bond markets, dealers said. Daily transactions in the London yen cash bond market now stand at 200 to 300 billion yen, but the extent of investor- linked transactions is unknown, securities bond managers said. \"Japanese corporations have been actively setting up their financing companies in London, suggesting they increasingly are engaging in, not only fund raising, but management there,\" Dezuka said. The steep increase in the number of branches of Japanese securities houses in London and the growing numbers of U.S. And U.K. Brokers coming to Tokyo has helped the London market\\'s growth, dealers said. Internationalisation of the yen is also likely to be promoted by yen bond trading in Chicago and New York later this year, securities managers said. The recent removal of a key regulatory obstacle by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission will allow the CBOT to apply to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission for a yen bond futures contract, they said. The ruling removed a regulation which prohibited trading futures of designated foreign government debt securities not located in the issuing country. Fundamental Brokers Inc, a major U.S. Brokers\\' broker, has decided to launch yen bond broking on its display system in New York as early as April. CBOT\\'s start of an evening session, planned for the end of April, will also multiply yen bond futures trading, a Nomura Securities Co Ltd bond manager said. But there are still obstacles to trading on the London market. \"Problems concerning cash bond delivery and clearing are major obstacles for an early launching at LIFFE,\" said Koki Chiyojima, deputy general manager of Nikko Securities Co Ltd\\'s bond administration division. Nikko Securities Co Ltd, one of the big four Japanese securities houses, is responsible for corresponding with LIFFE on these matters. Japan\\'s Finance Ministry will start issuing bonds with coupon payment of either March and September, or June and December from April 1, matching futures delivery months. The ministry now pays coupons in January, June, July and December. When delivery months and coupon payments do not match, a 20 pct withholding tax is imposed on interest earned by non-resident bond holders, a deterrent to LIFFE, securities managers said. LIFFE is likely to wait until the outstanding amount of bonds with matching months increases to over several billion yen, bond managers said. These bonds will be used for deliveries, as they are expected to be the cheapest deliverable issues due to low interest rates, they said. Market participants here expect a clearing organisation to be set up by the time they have substantial deliverable cash issues, making overseas listings probable in the latter half of 1987. U.K. MONEY MARKET OFFERED EARLY ASSISTANCE The Bank of England said it had invited an early round of bill offers from the discount houses after forecasting a shortage in the system of around 1.1 billion stg. Money market dealers speculated that the central bank could be taking the opportunity to signal a reduction in U.K. Base lending rates by cutting the rates at which it intervenes in the discount market. Most operators are expecting a base rate cut today, possibly of one point, following yesterday\\'s budget in which the U.K. Public sector borrowing target for 1987/88 was slashed by three billion stg. Among the main factors affecting liquidity, bills maturing in official hands and the take-up of treasury bills will drain some 1.11 billion stg while a rise in note circulation and bankers\\' balances below target will take out around 120 mln stg and 20 mln stg respectively. Partly offsetting these outflows, exchequer transactions will add some 140 mln stg to the system today. LAWSON SAYS HE IS CONTENT WITH CURRENT STERLING EXCHANGE RATE LAWSON SAYS HE IS CONTENT WITH CURRENT STERLING EXCHANGE RATE U.K. MONEY MARKET SHORTAGE FORECAST REVISED UP The Bank of England said it revised up its estimate of the deficit in the system today to 1.3 billion stg from 1.1 billion. The Bank has not provided any assistance to the market so far today but earlier invited the discount houses to use their borrowing facilities at 1430 GMT today and set the terms at 10 pct for 14 days. LAWSON HAPPY WITH STERLING, BACKS LATEST RATE CUT Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said he was content with the current level of sterling and welcomed today\\'s announcement of a further half point cut in British bank base lending rates to 10 pct. However, he said he wanted to see a gradual approach to declines in domestic U.K. Interest rates, although optimism in financial markets might push for big moves quickly. He told a briefing of economic journalists that \"I don\\'t think we should rush anything.\" Lawson stressed the themes of \"gradualism and steadiness\" as economic policy. Lawson acknowledged that today\\'s fall in interest rates were in response to his budget for fiscal 1987/88, unveiled yesterday to Parliament and which set a lower target for the key Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR) of 1.0 pct of GDP. Lawson said the two recent cuts in base rates, both made this month in the form of half percentage point declines, were \"perfectly consistent\" with monetary conditions now in Britain. He supported that by saying the narrow M0 money supply aggregate was \"safely inside\" its flucuation band of two to six pct set for both 1986/87 and 1987/88. In his budget, Lawson set no explicit target range for the broader sterling M3. Turning to the question of Britain eventually joining the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System (EMS), Lawson repeated that \"it is most unlikely we will enter before the next election.\" He said Britain was keeping the subject of full EMS membership under constant review. But he would not indicate what the chief considerations for this were for the government. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher late last year said a decision on whether or not to join depended on the strength of the U.K. Economy. But she later said such a move depended on other EMS countries scrapping residual capital controls. Although Lawson denounced what he said was \"the current wave of election fever\" in Britain, he added:  \"It is more likely that there will be an election this year\" than not. He said he supported an early election only because it would clear the air. \"Ideally, we (the government) should have a full term,\" but events could force a premature poll, Lawson said. The government, which has been in power since 1979, must call an election by June 1988. Speculation is rising for either a June or an early autumn election, political sources said. The decision to cut basic tax by only two pence in 1987/88 \"was the right balance, economically and politically,\" he said. Lawson\\'s decision to restrict the fall in the standard rate of tax to two-pence surprised many analysts, who had predicted that with Treasurys coffers full of tax revenue would have allowed the government to reach its goal of 25 pct in one move. But it was being praised today by political analysts as a shrewd move which, while advancing towards that aim, could not be seized upon by opposition parties as overtly trying to bribe the electorate. Lawson told journalists he had been surprised by how much the PSBR had undershot his original assumption of 7.1 billion stg for 1986/87 -- by some three billion stg. Returning to changing levels of interest rates, Lawson stressed that \"they are not an objective (for the government) - they are an instrument of policy.\" Consequently the Treasury had no precise target for domestic borrowing levels, he said. But \"there may be interest rate consequences\" from changes in the level of government borrowing, he added. Lawson said he did not think that the U.K.\\'s relatively high level of real interest rates had hurt investment in Britain. He said conditions created by London\\'s role as a leading financial centre had caused sterling interest rates to be higher in real terms than in other countries. Three factors had caused the higher level in relative interest rates in Britain, Lawson said. First, control of credit in Britain rested on interest rates alone, due to the freedom of its financial markets. He said the second reason was political uncertainty caused by proposed spending plans of the opposition Labour Party. Thirdly, he said \"we do not have as long a track record of low inflation\" as did the U.S., Japan and West Germany. Lawson foresaw London becoming the world\\'s pre-eminent financial centre, because it was more international in character and more favourably placed in time zones than New York or Tokyo. BUNDESBANK SEEN STEERING STEADY MONETARY COURSE The Bundesbank is likely to steer a steady monetary course over the next few weeks and a change in credit policies is not expected at tomorrow\\'s regular central bank council meeting, bank economists and dealers said. \"There is no need for action,\" Hermann Remsperger, chief economist of Berliner Handels- and Frankfurter Bank (BHF) said. Others noted that exchange rates are stable after last month\\'s Group of Six agreement in Paris and central bank money stock growth is still well above the three to six pct target zone, so a change in credit policies could be ruled out. One money market dealer said comments by Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl at a private seminar in Duesseldorf two weeks ago hinting at another interest rate cut only indicated the Bundesbank might act if conditions changed. Bank economists said U.S. Pressure on West Germany to further ease credit policies had receded since the Paris pact. But such demands could re-emerge if West Germany failed to stimulate its economy enough to affect the massive U.S. Trade deficit. Remsperger said continued strong money supply growth also precluded a further cut in official interest rates. Central bank money stock was growing at an annualized 7.5 pct in February, unchanged from the 7.5 pct in January. Economists said some of the 18 members of the central bank council were worried about the continued overshoot in the money supply target and were bound to resist any moves to cut rates. But Poehl played down the risk of inflation. Economists said the fact that money stock growth remained stable last month was a success. Some said it was likely to return to within the target range later this year. \"The special factors which boosted money supply growth last year are disappearing,\" one economist said. He said some 75 pct of the money supply increase in 1986 was caused by a sharp rise in the inflow of foreign funds. This trend had been reversed recently and with domestic credit demand likely to remain at steady levels, money stock growth was expected to narrow in the medium-term. These developments were increasing the Bundesbank\\'s scope for a rate cut in the medium-term, economists said. Money market dealers said period rates remained little changed, indicating no change in credit policy was expected. Call money rates declined to 3.75/80 pct from 3.90/95 yesterday, with the market well stocked with liquidity. Dealers said call money was soft because tax payments on behalf of customers had been less than expected so far. But rates were likely to tighten again as soon as the full effect of this month\\'s major tax payment period is felt. Payments for the federal railways bond are also likely to burden the market. The Bundesbank did not inject liquidity via a securities repurchase agreement this week, but countered a tightening in rates on Monday by injecting funds through government-owned banks. Dealers said recent securities repurchase pacts had shown the Bundesbank clearly wanted call money rates stable at 3.80. One dealer said, \"If the central bank wanted lower interest rates, it would first of all drive call money rates down.\" Banks remained relatively well stocked with minimum reserve assets. They held 52.9 billion marks in minimum reserves on Monday, averaging 53.7 billion marks over the first 16 days of March. A requirement of around 51 billion is expected. BANKERS TRUST ISSUING STG/DLR CURRENCY WARRANTS Bankers Trust International Ltd said it is issuing 200,000 stg call/dlr put currency warrants at an initial offer price of 31.25 dlrs per warrant. The issue is guaranteed by Bankers Trust New York Corp. Each warrant entitles the holder to exchange 500 dlrs for stg at a rate of 1.60 stg/dlr and the minimum number of warrants exercisable or tradeable is 100. Exercise period for the warrants will run from April 22, 1987 until March 17, 1989. Payment is due April 15, 1987. U.K. MONEY MARKET GIVEN 15 MLN STG AFTERNOON HELP The Bank of England said it had provided the money market with a further 15 mln stg assistance. This brings the Bank\\'s total help so far today to 344 mln stg and compares with the estimated shortage of around 1.3 billion stg. The central bank purchased bank bills outright, at the lower dealing rates established this morning, comprising one mln stg in band one at 9-7/8 pct and 14 mln stg in band two at 9-13/16 pct. U.K. BASE RATES WILL FALL AGAIN SOON, SAY ANALYSTS Today\\'s modest half-point cut in U.K. Bank base lending rates to 10 pct signals the Bank of England\\'s determination to maintain a cautious monetary stance, but financial markets appear set to force its hand, analysts said. They said a further half-point cut in base rates to 9-1/2 pct was bound to occur within the next week and rates may shed a further half point soon if markets remain buoyant. Earlier, markets were bracing for a one-point cut in rates after yesterday\\'s budget set a sharp three billion stg reduction in 1987 government borrowing targets to four billion stg. Sterling money market rates moved lower again, with the key three-month interbank rate down to 9-5/8 1/2 pct at the start of business from 9-11/16 9/16 yesterday, and sterling rallied to four-year highs against the dollar in very active trading. Government bond prices also surged on the budget, with gains in excess of one point pushing yields on long-term paper below nine pct for the first time in nearly a year. But today\\'s smaller than expected rate cut appeared to have placated markets for now, analysts said. Money market rates recovered up to 1/4 point from earlier lows while both sterling and gilts came off highs as trading ground to a near halt. Analysts said the slowdown was likely to be temporary, and the reappraisal of sterling assets by international investors was set to resume as early as tomorrow, leading to higher gilt prices, exchange rate advances and lower money market rates. \"Today\\'s cut was slightly disappointing,\" said Bill Martin, chief U.K. Economist at stockbrokers Phillips and Drew. \"The Bank of England is taking a very cautious line ... To temper the markets\\' first rush of blood to the head after the budget.\" Analysts said the bank\\'s move today to lend two-week cash to U.K. Discount houses at a lower 10 pct suggested it hoped to maintain the new rates for about that period of time. The analysts agreed success would depend largely on how sterling performs in the near term. Sharp rises in the pound\\'s value could be checked initially through Bank of England intervention but eventually the gains would force the bank to cut interest rates rates again. \"The market seems to have accepted the modest cut for the time being,\" said Midland Bank treasury economist David Simmonds. \"But I am sceptical that the bank will be able to hold up rates for long.\" Simmonds said he saw sterling rising another two U.S. Cents this week from around 1.60 dlrs, forcing a rate cut by Friday. Robin Marshall, chief economist at Chase Manhattan Securities, said \"There is another half point to come in the near term, this week or next week at the latest...We see a whole point off base rates in the next two or three weeks.\" Analysts stressed that apart from prestige, Britain had very little to gain from a sharp rise in sterling\\'s exchange rate. Martin, of Phillips and Drew, said the dampening effect of a sterling rise on consumer price inflation would not materialise for at least nine months while its hampering impact on manufactured exports would show almost immediately. Analysts said the budget, featuring income tax cuts as well as cautious plans for public finances, had improved the chances of re-election for the Conservative government and probably advanced the election date. One must be held before June, 1988. Combined with overall good prospects for the U.K. Economy, this was likely to fuel a foreign rush on sterling-denominated assets, pushing the pound\\'s value well above unofficial targets. With mark-denominated investments largely out of favour because of low yields and a dull economic outlook, Chase\\'s Marshall said \"Sterling is simply the best game in town, especially after the budget, and demand will remain strong.\" FED EXPECTED TO ADD RESERVES IN MONEY MARKET The Federal Reserve is expected to enter the U.S. Government securities market to add temporary reserves indirectly via 1.5 billion dlrs or more of customer repurchase agreements, economists said. They said the below-six pct Federal funds rate suggests the Fed does not have a large reserve adding need. However, some dealers reportedly backed out of the three-day System repurchase agreements set on Monday, leaving the Fed with a somewhat increased need to supply reserves. Federal funds, which averaged 6.05 pct yesterday, opened at 5-15/16 pct and remained there in early trading. GULF ARAB STATES MOVE TOWARDS ECONOMIC INTEGRATION Finance and economy ministers of the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) have ended talks after adopting resolutions and recommendations aimed at boosting economic integration. But the ministers from Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) did not endorse a resolution on a common currency exchange rate system. The UAE\\'s Minister of State for Finance and Industry, Ahmed Humaid al-Tayer, told reporters after the two-day talks that the ministers referred the issue back to GCC central bank governors for further discussion. He said the governors, who agreed in January on a proposed denominator on which the six currencies should be based, were asked to resubmit the recommendation before July, when finance ministers were due to meet in Saudi Arabia. Bankers said the central bank governors would meet soon to discuss the issue, adding there was a possibility that a new system could be submitted for final approval to a GCC summit conference scheduled to be held in Saudi Arabia late this year. The denominator approved by the governors has not been made public, but banking sources said it could be similar to the European Monetary System (EMS). Tayer said the ministers agreed in principle to allow GCC citizens to set up businesses and work in any member state. They also agreed in principle on a recommendation for citizens to buy and own shares of GCC shareholding firms. He said the ministers discussed a report on imported goods containing radiation caused by last year\\'s Chernobyl nuclear disaster in the Soviet Union, and agreed all products with excessive levels should be returned to the country of origin. FORMER N.Z. PREMIER CALLS FOR CHEAPER CURRENCY Former Prime Minister Robert Muldoon, an outspoken advocate of a managed float for the N.Z. Dollar, said the currency is at least 10 pct overvalued. Muldoon said in a speech last night the exchange rate should be around 48 U.S. Cents instead of the current 57 cents. \"A reasonable value for the New Zealand dollar would be between 10 and 15 pct less and nearer 15 than 10. Perhaps around about 48 cents,\" he said. The Labour Party government removed exchange controls and floated the dollar two years ago when it was worth 44 cents. Muldoon has no rank in the opposition National Party, and party leaders, with an eye to general elections to be held by September, have rejected his calls for a managed float. He said the dollar was high because of \"grossly excessive\" interest rates for government stock. \"I know of no other country which is implementing such a free floating policy,\" he added. \"There is widespread agreement internationally that we have no alternative to floating currencies in the short to medium term. But we need more effective methods of managing them so as to limit the volatility which has caused so much concern and damage.\" U.K. MONEY MARKET DEFICIT FORECAST AT 450 MLN STG The Bank of England said it forecast a shortage of around 450 mln stg in the money market today. Among the main factors affecting liquidity, bills maturing in official hands and the take-up of treasury bills will drain some 650 mln stg while a rise in note circulation will take out around 30 mln stg. Partly offsetting these outflows, bankers\\' balances above target and exchequer transactions will add some 200 mln stg and 35 mln stg to the system respectively. U.K. MONEY MARKET SHORTAGE FORECAST REVISED DOWN The Bank of England said it revised down its estimate of the deficit in the system today to 400 mln stg from 450 mln. U.K. MONEY MARKET GIVEN 181 MLN STG ASSISTANCE The Bank of England said it provided the money market with 181 mln stg in assistance this morning. This compares with the Bank\\'s revised shortage forecast of around 400 mln stg. The central bank purchased bank bills outright at the new dealing rates established yesterday. These comprised 65 mln stg in band one at 9-7/8 pct, 114 mln stg in band two at 9-13/16 pct and two mln stg in band three at 9-3/4 pct. U.S. CREDIT MARKET OUTLOOK - SPENDING, M-1 Brisk increases in personal income and consumption are to appear in February data released today, but the bond market\\'s recent sluggishness suggests there will be no major price reaction unless the rises are much larger than expected, economists said. Personal income is forecast to rise by 0.6 to 0.8 pct, compared with no change in January, while consumption expenditures are projected to increase 1.4 to 1.6 pct, reversing most of the two pct drop recorded in January. M-1 money supply data for the March 9 week will also be released. An increase of some 2.3 billion dlrs is expected. Peter Greenbaum of Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co Inc expects a one pct rise in income, led by a strong gain in wage and salary disbursements in February. Nonfarm payrolls expanded by 337,000 jobs in February, the average workweek lengthened by 0.6 pct and hourly wages rose by four cts, he noted in a report. Vigorous spending on durable goods last month, especially cars, foreshadow a rise of at least 1.5 pct in consumption, he added. The prospect of bearish data did not trouble the bond market much yesterday, with the 30-year Treasury bond slipping just 7/32 to 99-28/32 for a yield of 7.51 pct. Analysts said the market is still trapped in a narrow range, desperately seeking direction. \"Seasonally adjusted, it\\'s already December in the bond market,\" quipped Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co International Inc. Paul Boltz of T. Rowe Price Associates Inc said the steadiness of long bond yields around 7.5 pct, despite some signs of a stronger economy, probably reflects expectations that inflation will remain subdued. But he warned that this assumption might not be justified. \"It took the bond market a long while to see that inflation was not returning to double digits, and now that it has learned that lesson, it may be a little slow to see that a four to five pct inflation is a real possibility ahead,\" Boltz said in a report. After trading late yesterday at 5-15/16 pct, Fed funds were indicated by brokers to open comfortably at 5-15/16, six pct. S.AFRICA\\'S FINANCIAL RAND SEEN HEADED HIGHER The financial rand, widely viewed as a direct reflection of foreign investor confidence in South Africa, appears headed above 30 U.S. Cents, dealers and bank economists said. The currency has risen about 25 pct in the past three months to its current rate of 29.50 cents, due partly to signs of a possible power shift with the appearance of a number of independent candidates in the whites-only election on May 6, they added. It has risen about two cents this week alone. \"Another factor is that banks in London, where the main market is based, are going long in the currency because of a general feeling that it will rise in the future,\" one economist said. Dealers described 30 cents as a psychological barrier that was expected to be broken soon after a brief consolidation phase from recent gains. After reaching 30 cents, \"There is a chance of appreciation to 32 cents in the next several weeks,\" one dealer said. There was a widespread feeling that both the commercial rand, holding stable at 48 cents, and the financial rand were staying firm, banking sources said. A Barclays National Bank executive who asked not to be identified said: \"The rise of the independents appears to be indicative of a potential shift of power in the National Party and has created a favourable sentiment overseas.\" One dealer said growing business and investor interest from West Germany and Switzerland were behind the financial rand\\'s rise. Economists said foreigners also were being attracted by South Africa\\'s long-term government bonds and \"semi-gilts\" or securities in partly government-owned firms, many with yields as high as 30 pct. They could be purchased with financial rands with interest paid in commercial rands. \"This has had a definite influence on the financial form of the rand,\" a dealer said, adding that at present demand is slightly in excess of supply. The financial rand was reintroduced in September 1985 to help end capital flight from South Africa during a period of severe political unrest in the country. U.K. MONEY MARKET GIVEN FURTHER 191 MLN STG HELP The Bank of England said it gave the money market a further 191 mln stg assistance in the afternoon session. This takes the Bank\\'s total help so far today to 372 mln stg and compares with its upwards revised estimate of the shortage in the system of around 400 mln stg. The central bank bought bank bills outright comprising 15 mln stg in band one at 9-7/8 pct and 176 mln stg in band two at 9-13/16 pct. U.K. MONEY MARKET GIVEN 40 MLN STG LATE ASSISTANCE The bank of England said it provided the money market with late assistance of around 40 mln stg. This brings the Bank\\'s total help today to some 412 mln stg and compares with its forecast of a shortage in the sytem of around 400 mln stg. FED EXPECTED TO TAKE NO MONEY MARKET ACTION The Federal Reserve is expected to refrain from reserve-management intervention in the U.S. Government securities market, economists said. If the Fed does act, however, they said it would be likely to add temporary reserves indirectly by arranging around 1.5 billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreements. Federal funds, which averaged 5.97 pct yesterday, opened at six pct and remained there in early trading. FED SAYS IT SETS 1.5 BILLION DLRS OF CUSTOMER REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS FED SAYS IT SETS 1.5 BILLION DLRS OF CUSTOMER REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS FED ADDS RESERVES VIA CUSTOMER REPURCHASES The Federal Reserve entered the U.S. Government securities market to arrange 1.5 billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreements, a Fed spokesman said. Dealers said Federal funds were trading at six pct when the Fed began its temporary and indirect supply of reserves to the banking system. FED\\'S JOHNSON URGES STRONGER ALLIED GROWTH Federal Reserve Board Vice Chairman Manuel Johnson said that the U.S.\\'s main industrial partners should expand their domestic growth. In a speech to a women\\'s group here, Johnson said, \"There is room for stronger domestic growth in those countries ... strong enough to absorb growth in U.S. export markets.\" Johnson also said there was a better alignment of exchange rates now and the Paris agreement to stabilize currencies has brought western nations a long way towards establishing that goal. Johnson said, \"The Fed supports this pattern of exchange rates ... and we\\'ll see if it leads to a convergence in trade. Quite possibly it can be achieved.\" Johnson said the Paris agreement achieved a better alignment of exchange rates in exchange for stimulus by the major surplus countries. He said this was \"a major improvement and a step in the right direction\" and added U.S. allies look very strongly to a U.S. budget deficit cut. \"There will always be a potential risk of breakdown in international cooperation\" without a budget deficit cut. U.K. MONEY DATA MAY EASE RATE CUT, ANALYSTS SAY Slower than expected growth in Britain\\'s narrow M0 money supply measure in February will help spur a further cut in U.K. Interest rates if a surge in sterling\\'s value requires such a move, economic analysts said. M0, the only targeted money supply measure left after Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson scrapped the official target for the broad sterling M3 measure in his 1987 budget speech on Tuesday, fell an adjusted 3/4 to one pct in February. On an annual basis, this put M0 growth at four to 4-1/2 pct, in the middle of the 1987 target of two to six pct. \"The M0 data are much better than we expected,\" said Robert Thomas, economist at Greenwell Montagu Securities. He and other analysts said while the better than expected M0 figures alone would not be sufficient to trigger a new interest rate cut, they removed an obstacle to such a move. Thomas noted the rise in M0 had been kept in check despite buoyant retail sales in February, advancing an adjusted 2.2 pct after a fall of the same size in January. Analysts said the M0 measure, reflecting variations in consumer demand rather than real inflation prospects, was not an adequate indicator to determine interest rates. \"The authorities still seem to want to pretend that M0 is important ... In practice, it is likely to be the exchange rate and the election which call the tune,\" Lloyds Merchant bank chief economist Roger Bootle wrote in a budget comment. Richard Jeffrey, economist at stockbrokers Hoare Govett, said in a comment: \"It is unlikely that (Lawson) will respond to signals from M0 alone ... Reinforcement from exchange rate trends is necessary before action is taken.\" \"With the Chancellor making clear that policy manoeuvres are made in response to signals from this narrow money variable, the City has been forced to take it seriously,\" he added. Noting this point, Thomas said market fears at the end of last year of an M0 overshoot had now disappeared. This removed a potential obstacle to a further cut in U.K. Base lending rates if foreign demand for sterling pushed up the pound above unofficial targets, analysts said. Such targets are believed to have been secretly agreed between finance ministers of the Group of Five and Canada at their Paris meeting last month, they added. U.K. Base rates have been cut twice by half a point since the Paris agreement, once on March 11, and again yesterday when foreign demand for sterling surged in reaction to a sharp cut in 1987 government borrowing targets contained in the budget. They stand at 10 pct now, and foreign exchange dealers and analysts expect them to shed another half-point in the coming week. Analysts shrugged off as largely irrelevant a higher than expected increase in February sterling M3, which pushed the annual growth rate to almost 19 pct, well above the previous target of 11 to 15 pct. Thomas said the February figures seemed to indicate the improvement in sterling M3 growth witnessed over the past few months had been reversed, but firm conclusions could only be drawn after revised data are released on March 31. Some analysts said foreign investors had long ceased to watch the sterling M3 target, and Lawson\\'s move to scrap it altogether earlier this week removed whatever was left of its credibility as a key factor in monetary policy. SPRINKEL URGES GREATER GROWTH IN JAPAN, EUROPE Beryl Sprinkel, chairman of the president\\'s council of economic advisors, said stronger domestic demand growth in Japan and Western Europe is needed to help stimulate U.S. exports without having to rely on futher dollar declines. \"Stronger domestic demand growth in the major foreign industrial countries is needed to engender the much needed expansion of U.S. export markets without having to rely on further dollar depreciation,\" he told the Futures Industry Association. Sprinkel said the recent recovery of domestic demand in Japan and Europe has been one of the weakest in the post-war period. \"Stronger domestic demand growth in the major industrial countries would help give balance to the current world recovery,\" he said. Asked if Japan was not living up to commitments made last month to trading partners, he said recent figures showed Japan\\'s economy grew by about 0.5 pct in the fourth quarter of 1986, \"Not enough to sustain employment growth.\" However, Sprinkel said Japan had not reneged on its pledges and was moving toward more stimulative policies, including tax reform. \"I suspect there will be further moves,\" he said. Sprinkel repeated his call for further cuts in U.S. government spending and for resistance to tax increases. \"Reducing the federal government budget deficit by expenditure restraint is needed to preserve the low marginal tax rates achieved by tax reform,\" he said, adding that \"a vote to increase to government expenditures is a vote against tax reform.\" Sprinkel said the fall of the dollar had substantially restored U.S. cost competitiveness and that the deterioration of the U.S. trade balance appeared to have abated. However, he said that \"sole reliance on dollar depreciation to reduce our trade deficit is not desirable,\" as it risks inflation in the United States and recession abroad. \"I am confident that further improvements in our trade performance will contribute significantly to growth in 1987,\" he said. Improvements in the U.S. trade balance, he said, will come about largely from a swing in manufactures trade and present \"serious adjustment problems for U.S. trading partners.\" Western Europe, where manufactures output and employment have been weak, promises to be especially hard hit by the improvement in the U.S. trade balance, Sprinkel said. He defended flexible exchange rates saying wide swings in rates were not a fault of the system but of the undesirable policies that produced them. ITALIAN PANEL URGES EXCHANGE LIBERALIZATION Liberalization of Italy\\'s foreign exchange controls should be \"gradual\" but also \"reasonably rapid,\" a report issued by a study committee nominated by the Italian Treasury Ministry said. The report, looking at the country\\'s financial development prospects, said Italy\\'s large public sector deficit and growing public debt were among the considerations that made a gradual liberalization preferable. The report also favoured retention of the lira\\'s six pct oscillation band with the European Monetary System (EMS) during the liberalization process in order to lessen short-term domestic interest rate fluctuations which could result from portfolio adjustments. The lira\\'s fluctuation margin is currently significantly higher than that allowed for other EMS currencies. Italy has over recent months announced a series of deregulation moves in response to a European Community directive aimed at creating a genuine common market in goods, services and finance by 1992. LAWSON REPEATS HE IS CONTENT WITH STERLING LEVEL U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel today repeated that he was satisfied with the current level of sterling, both against the dollar and the West German mark. Lawson said in a television interview that he did not regard the pound\\'s present exchange rate was uncomfortably high. \"I think it is round about right,\" he said. \"I think there was a time that they (British manufacturers) thought the (exchange) rate was uncomfortably high. But I think they are very satisfied with the present level.\" \"But I have made it absolutely clear that I don\\'t want to see the pound go through the roof,\" he added. SINGAPORE EXCHANGE PLANS OPTIONS CONTRACTS The Singapore International Monetary Exchange Ltd, SIMEX, said it would launch at least two options on futures contracts this year. SIMEX said in a press release that the options contracts would be based on the currency and interest rate futures currently traded on the exchange and be started \"toward the third quarter.\" SIMEX, which is linked to the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, currently trades three currency futures -- on Deutsche marks, Japanese yen and British pounds -- and two interest rate futures -- on U.S. Treasury-bonds and three-month Eurodollars. SHORT-TERM YEN INTEREST RATES SEEN FALLING SOON Japanese short-term interest rates, buoyed recently by seasonal factors, are likely to fall from the beginning of April when the new financial year begins, money traders said. The Bank of Japan is expected to encourage the trend following its attempts to pressure rates to enhance its discount rate cut on February 23, they said. The Bank cut the rate to 2.5 pct from three, and began actively injecting funds into the money market to offset rate rises resulting from the end-of-fiscal-year surge in demand for funds from financial institutions. Despite its attempts to dampen rates with measures such as aggressive commercial bill purchases, the central bank has failed to remove all upward pressure, money traders said. Attractive interest rates offered by domestic banks to compete for time deposits of more than 600 mln yen has underpinned short-term rates, they said. Interest rates on time deposits of more than 600 mln yen were decontrolled by the Finance Ministry last September. This resulted in such deposits with domestic banks rising to 17,830 billion yen by the end-December, a three-fold increase on end-December 1985 levels, bankers said. On March 31, the money market expects to see a 2,000 billion yen surplus resulting from government payment of fiscal funds, money traders said. From April 1, they predict the unconditional call rate will fall to 3.5000 pct from 3.7500 pct today and the one-month commercial bill discount rate to drop to 3.7500 pct from 4.0635 pct. They predict the three-month bill discount rate to slip to 3.875 pct from 4.0000 today and the three-month certificate of deposit rate to slide to 4.10/4.15 from 4.35/25. NEW DUTCH ADVANCES TOTAL FOUR BILLION GUILDERS The Dutch Central Bank said it has accepted bids totalling 4.00 billion guilders at tender this morning for new five-day special advances at 5.3 pct for the period March 20 to 25. Subscriptions to 250 mln guilders were fully met, amounts above 250 mln at 30 pct. The new facility replaces old 11-day advances totalling 6.5 billion guilders at the same rate. U.K. MONEY MARKET OFFERED EARLY ASSISTANCE The Bank of England said it had invited an early round of bill offers from the discount houses after forecasting a shortage of around 950 mln stg in the money market today. Among the main factors affecting liquidity, bills maturing in official hands and the take-up of treasury bills will drain around 572 mln stg while a rise in note circulation wil take out some 280 mlns stg. In addition, exchequer transactions and bankers\\' balances below target will remove some 85 mln stg and 15 mln stg for the system respectively. BANK OF FINLAND WILL ANNOUNCE NEW MEASURES The Bank of Finland called a news conference at 1200 GMT to announce new measures for the \"development of the system of monetary control.\" A spokesman for the Bank declined to give further details. Banking sources said they expected the bank to announce it will actively take part in the interbank market and buy and sell certificates of deposit. The state treasury issues government paper with a maturity of up to one year. The central bank has so far not issued its own paper, the sources said. U.K. MONEY MARKET GIVEN 728 MLN STG EARLY HELP The Bank of England said it had provided the money market with 728 mln stg assistance in response to an early round of bill offers from the discount houses. Earlier, the Bank had estimated the shortage in the system today at 950 mln stg. The central bank purchased 625 mln stg of bills for resale to the market on April 7 at rates of interest between 9-15/16 pct and 10 pct. It also bought 103 mln stg bank bills outright comprising 65 mln stg in band one at 9-7/8 pct and 38 mln stg in band two at 9-13/16 pct. BANK OF SPAIN SUSPENDS ASSISTANCE, DRAINS FUNDS The Bank of Spain suspended its daily money market assistance and offered to drain funds with three- and seven-day repurchase agreements at 12-1/2 pct, money market sources said. The sources said the measures were a further attempt to rein in money supply and were likely to force some institutions to scramble for funds before the 10-day accounting period for reserve requirements closes on Monday. The bank, which raised its rate for ordinary overnight assistance to 13-3/4 from 13-1/2 pct on Wednesday, opened its special borrowing facility for overnight funds at 14-1/2 pct. Money market sources said institutions in need of funds were likely to have to return to the bank tomorrow for further assistance. The bank rarely invites applications for ordinary assistance on a Saturday and the sources said it was more likely to open its special borrowing facility again. U.K. MONEY MARKET GIVEN FURTHER 31 MLN STG HELP The Bank of England said it gave the money market another 31 mln stg in assistance in the morning session. This brings the Bank\\'s total help today to 759 mln stg and compares with its estimate of a 1.05 billion stg money market shortage which it earlier revised up from 950 mln stg. The central bank bought 31 mln stg of bank bills outright in band two at 9-13/16 pct. BANK OF SPAIN SUSPENDS ASSISTANCE, DRAINS FUNDS The Bank of Spain suspended its daily money market assistance and offered to drain funds with three- and seven-day repurchase agreements at 12-1/2 pct, money market sources said.

The bank rarely invites applications for ordinary assistance on a Saturday and the sources said it was more likely to open its special borrowing facility again. JAPAN UNDER ATTACK OVER TRADE SURPLUS Japan\\'s economic policies face fierce international attack as hopes fade of a substantial drop in its trade surplus, international monetary sources said. At a meeting this week in Paris, senior government officials from major nations are considering an Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) staff report that forecasts a continuing large Japanese trade surplus, they said. Though Japanese exports have become more expensive with the yen\\'s sharp rise against the dollar, they still tend to surge when growth picks up, according to the OECD. As a solution, the OECD staff has urged Japan to redirect its export-driven economy, boosting domestic demand and imports by adopting a more flexible fiscal policy, they said. That recommendation echoes calls made recently at secret meetings of the International Monetary Fund\\'s executive board. The monetary sources said Japan\\'s policy was criticized when the board met to consider the country\\'s economy under the annual consultations it holds with each of its members. The United States, which until recently has been reluctant to criticize Japan\\'s fiscal stance, joined in the attack, he said. The IMF staff has also cast doubt on the Japanese government\\'s forecast of 3.5 pct economic growth in the fiscal year beginning April 1. Most independent forecasters, including the IMF, believe that growth in calendar 1987 will be below three pct, monetary sources said. The Finance Ministry has been particularly sensitive to such criticism because it is already under mounting domestic pressure to boost an economy hard-hit by the yen\\'s rise. The yen\\'s climb has lost exporters sales and profits in the huge American market. Tokyo is also eager to avoid any suggestion that a further yen rise might be needed to cut its trade surplus, which last year amounted to a record 93 billion dlrs. Japan cannot tolerate a further rise of the yen, Foreign Minister Tadashi Kuranari said recently. The yen closed here today at 151.53 to the dollar. Most Japanese politicians, including Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, are clearly hoping the yen will weaken, government officials said. At a meeting in Paris last month, Britain, Canada, France, Japan, the United States and West Germany, agreed to cooperate to hold currencies at around current levels. Officials said that wording represented a compromise. Miyazawa hopes the agreement will hold the yen stable for a few months, before it weakens later in the year. Japan wanted the Paris communique to imply a higher value for the dollar, perhaps by substituting the word \"recent\" for \"current,\" while the United States wanted it to more clearly point to the dollar\\'s weaker levels now, perhaps by use of the word \"present,\" they said. In the months leading up the February 22 agreement, the dollar dropped some 10 yen. The officials also sought to discredit suggestions in the market that recent U.S. Action to prevent the dollar from rising above 1.87 marks pointed to a 153 to 155 yen ceiling for the U.S. Currency. Japan has also attacked OECD forecasts, which it says do not take account of the structural changes in the Japanese economy that will be triggered by the strong yen. Officials said there are already signs of that. More and more companies have announced plans to move production facilities offshore to take advantage of cheaper costs abroad, they said. U.K. MONEY MARKET GETS 186 MLN STG AFTERNOON HELP The Bank of England said it had given the money market a further 186 mln stg assistance in the afternoon session. This brings the Bank\\'s total help so far today to 945 mln stg and compares with its revised forecast of a one billion stg deficit. The central bank bought bank bills outright comprising 51 mln stg in band one at 9-7/8 pct and 135 mln stg in band two at 9-13/16 pct. TREASURY\\'S BAKER SUPPORTS FED MONETARY POLICY Treasury Secretary James Baker said in a newspaper interview that he supports the current course of Federal Reserve Board monetary policy. \"The course of Fed policy is quite adequate as far as we are concerned,\" Baker said in an interview with the New York Times. In the interview, Baker declined to comment about the recent Paris accord among the six leading industrialized democracies when he was asked why the U.S. agreed to stabilize the dollar at current levels when the trade deficit hit a record level last year. Baker said in the newspaper interview that it was \"a subject I prefer not to talk about.\" He said that if he explained why the U.S. agreed to help maintain the dollar at current levels \"I would of necessity end up getting into some of the private agreements that support such and agreement\" on the dollar. Baker was optimistic about Brazil, which has stopped interest payments on much of its outstanding debt with foreign commercial banks. \"They are, after all, paying on time all the debt service and principal on their official debts, having just rescheduled with the Paris Club,\" Baker said in the newspaper interview. Baker said that Brazilian repreentatives had explained they intented to pay their commercial bank debts in full but needed time. BANK OF FINLAND TO TRADE IN BANKS\\' CERTIFICATES The Bank of Finland said it has started dealings in banks\\' certificates of deposits (CDs) with immediate effect and that it was prepared to issue its own paper to stimulate operations on the domestic money market. Bank of Finland Governor Rolf Kullberg told a news conference the Bank will also limit credits on the call money market from March 30, 1987, by introducing a maximum credit amount and a penalty rate if banks exceed this ceiling. \"The recent introduction of three-month money and these new regulations are decreasing the role of the call money market and the discount rate as monetary instruments,\" Kullberg said. Bankers welcomed the central bank measures saying these were needed to accelerate the domestic money market. The Bank of Finland had never before been allowed to issue its own CDs, they said. \"The central bank for the first time has an instrument with which it really can influence the price of money in this country,\" one banker said. Under the new rules banks are limited to call money credits to a maximum of 7.5 pct of the total of their equity capital and cash reserves. A penalty rate of interest of 19 pct is now introduced if the limit is exceeded. Director Sixten Korkman at the Bank of Finland\\'s monetary department said he expected the bank to pursue an active policy on the interbank market as an issuer of own-CDs. \"We are free to do it, so maybe on Monday we will issue the first, just to see how the system functions. Overall I think we will issue at least a few times a week,\" Korkman told Reuters. He said the bank was likely to aim at CDs with a three-month maturity at first as the market was best developed for paper of that maturity. The Bank of Finland introduced last December three-month credits and deposits at rates determined by the central bank and the commercial banks as a shift away from the traditional overnight call money market. Liquidity on the call credit market has fallen from around nine billion markka in early December to 167 mln last week, while three-month credits have risen to three to four billion. On the interbank market there has been an increasing trade in banks\\' CDs, estimated to be some eight billion markka. In addition, commercial paper accounts for around five billion markka and Treasury Bills two billion. FED EXPECTED TO SET CUSTOMER REPURCHASES The Federal Reserve is expected to intervene in the government securities market to add temporary reserves indirectly via 1.5-2.0 billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreements, economists said. Federal funds, which averaged 6.06 pct yesterday, opened at 6-1/16 pct and remained there in early trading. FED SAYS IT SETS 1.5 BILLION DLRS OF CUSTOMER REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS FED SAYS IT SETS 1.5 BILLION DLRS OF CUSTOMER REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS FED ADDS RESERVES VIA CUSTOMER REPURCHASES The Federal Reserve entered the U.S. Government securities market to arrange 1.5 billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreements, a Fed spokesman said. Dealers said Federal funds were trading at 6-1/16 pct when the Fed began its temporary and indirect supply of reserves to the banking system. LEADING ECONOMISTS CALL FOR MORE GROWTH ABROAD A panel of four leading economists told a congressional hearing today that foreign economies will need to expand to avoid recession as the U.S. trade deficit declines. C. Fred Bergsten, a former senior Treasury Department official, and Robert Solomon of the Brookings Institution told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the major exporting countries risk recession if they do not expand because U.S. demand for imports is expected to fall. \"They need to beef up domestic demand as their trade surplus falls,\" or unemployment will keep growing, Bergsten said. Bergsten predicted the U.S. trade deficit, which hit 169 billion dlrs last year, will fall 30-40 billion dlrs a year for the next two years as a result of the dollar\\'s 35-40 pct decline since September 1985. The government should intervene to push the dollar down further if the previous declines do not lead to an improvement in the trade picture, if the U.S. budget deficit is not reduced and if foreign expansion does not occur, he added. Solomon said the dollar must fall further to compensate for the huge interest payments required on U.S. foreign debt. The Paris agreement between the major industrialized countries provided only for a pause in its decline, he said. Rimmer de Vries, senior vice president of Morgan Guaranty Trust Co., said the U.S. trade deficit problem is a problem of lagging growth in industrial economies, prolonged currency misalignment, debt problems of the developing countries, and unbalanced growth in the Asian industrializing countries. John Makin of the American Enterprise Institute, suggested foreign tax cuts to increase demand and pick up the slack from the U.S. trade deficit fall. G-10 FINANCE OFFICIALS DISCUSS DEBT, CURRENCIES Deputy Finance Ministers from the Group of 10 leading western industrialised countries met here to discuss the world debt crisis, trade imbalances and currency stability today following last month\\'s Paris monetary accord, sources close to the talks said. The officials met at the offices of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to discuss broad aspects of world monetary policy in preparation for the IMF\\'s interim committee meeting in Washington in April. The talks were the first high-level international review of the monetary situation since the accord last month reached by the U.S., West Germany, France, Britain, Japan and Canada to stabilise world currency markets at around present levels following the 40 pct slide in the dollar since mid-1985. Other countries represented at today\\'s talks were Italy, which refused to attend last month\\'s meeting on the grounds that it was being excluded from the real discussions, the Netherlands, Belgium and Switzerland. Many of the officials had met earlier today and yesterday within the framework of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) to review the slow progress being made in cutting the record 170 billion dlr U.S. Trade deficit and persuading West Germany and Japan to open their economies to more foreign imports. NO ZIMBABWE DOLLAR DEVALUATION - CENTRAL BANK Zimbabwe\\'s Reserve Bank, the nation\\'s central bank, has denied the Zimbabwe dollar would be devalued. Bank Governor Kombo Moyana told The Herald daily newspaper \"unfortunate and completely unfounded speculation that a depreciation of the Zimbabwe dollar was about to occur\" had aggravated a serious foreign exchange shortage. \"During February and the early part of March this (speculation) caused importers to bring forward their payments and exporters to delay as long as possible the inward remittance of export receipts, resulting in a significant slowdown in net foreign exchange inflows,\" he added. NIGERIA CHANGES AUCTION RULES TO DEFEND THE NAIRA Nigeria\\'s Central Bank has changed the rules governing its foreign exchange auctions in what analysts see as a means of defending the naira currency, which has depreciated steadily. The bank said in a statement that from April 2, banks bidding for foreign exchange would have to pay at the rate they offered and not, as presently, at the rate of the lowest successful bid made at the auction. This should discourage banks from bidding high to ensure that they were successful while paying the lower \"marginal\" rate, analysts said. \"It should act as a brake because banks will know that if they bid high they will have to pay what they offered,\" a Western diplomat commented. The naira has depreciated against the dollar by 62 pct since the auctions, known as the Second-Tier Foreign Exchange Market (SFEM), began last September 26. At last week\\'s session the Nigerian currency was fixed at 4.0 to the dollar, the third fall in a row. \"They were clearly worried... And this is the logical way of trying to stop the trend,\" the diplomat said. The Central Bank also announced the auctions would be fortnightly, not weekly, beginning on April 2. It was not immediately clear whether next Thursday\\'s scheduled session would still take place, nor if the bank was planning to double the 50 mln dlrs which are normally on offer at each auction. Demand for foreign exchange has consistently outstripped supply, encouraging banks to bid high and thus further weakening the naira. If the normal weekly allocation is not doubled at the fortnightly session, high demand could undermine the objective of the new system, analysts said. Although bidding banks will now pay what they offered, the official exchange rate for the naira applying to business transactions will continue to be the marginal rate -- the lowest successful bid. SFEM is a central part of Nigeria\\'s structural adjustment program, which is considered to be the most ambitious economic recovery plan in Black Africa. The program involves setting a realistic exchange rate for the naira, which was over-valued for many years, liberalising imports, boosting agriculture, removing subsidies and reducing inefficient government participation in the economy. The World Bank has played a prominent part in designing this dramatic blue-print and in selling it to an often sceptical public which fears inflation and lower living standards. Ishrat Husain, the World Bank\\'s representative in Nigeria, said yesterday he was satisfied both with the adjustment program as a whole and the foreign exchange auctions. \"So far so good\" he told a meeting of bankers in Lagos, adding that only members of Nigeria\\'s import-dependent elite would suffer hardship while the common man would benefit. Fears that the program would encourage inflation were incorrect, he said. Bumper harvests had reduced rural inflation and urban prices had already reflected the naira\\'s black market value before the currency was allowed to find its true level last September. BAKER DENIES DOLLAR TARGET EXISTS U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker again said the meeting of six major industrial nations in Paris last month did not establish a target exchange rate for the dollar. Baker said in a television interview aired here yesterday: \"We don\\'t have a target for the dollar.\" He declined to comment on what might be a desired level for the dollar, saying: \"We really don\\'t talk about the dollar.\" He said protectionism was becoming \"extremely strong\" in the U.S. In response to widening U.S. Trade deficits and import barriers in other countries. \"The mood in the United States is extremely disturbing. It\\'s extremely strong,\" he said. \"As I\\'ve said before, we sort of see ourselves as engaged here in a real struggle to preserve the world\\'s free trading system, because if the largest market in the world (the U.S.) goes protectionist we run the risk of moving down the same path that the world did in the late 1930s,\" he said. While relative exchange rates had a role to play in defusing the threat of protectionism, it alone did not offer any solution, he said. \"You must address this problem on the exchange rate side, but it cannot be solved on the exchange rate side alone. It\\'s far more comprehensive and broad than that, and the solution of it requires a comprehensive approach,\" Baker said in the interview. Baker said it would be necessary for other countries to adjust their currencies upwards, as well as remove their barriers to U.S. Imports. But he did not elaborate or name any countries. U.S. CREDIT MARKET OUTLOOK - MINI-REFUNDING A hefty slice of new U.S. Treasury supply is not the most welcome prospect for a slumbering credit market, but at least this week\\'s offerings should provide it with some focus, economists said. \"Banks and mutual funds have cash that should be put to work, so the auctions should breathe some life into the market,\" said economists at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc. The Treasury will place a 25 billion dlr package of two-year, four-year and seven-year notes on the sales block this week. The \"mini-refunding,\" which will raise 9.27 billion dlrs in new cash, comprises 10 billion dlrs of two-year notes for auction on Tuesday, 7.75 billion dlrs of four-year notes on Wednesday and 7.25 billion dlrs of seven-year notes on Thursday. The market also faces the regular weekly three- and six-month bill auction today, amounting to 12.8 billion dlrs. The mini-refunding does not come at a particularly auspicious time for the market. Bond prices have been drifting sideways in a narrow range against the backdrop of a cloudy U.S. Economic outlook, diminished chances of a change in Federal Reserve Board policy and a stable dollar. Moreover, the bond market\\'s inertia has compared unfavourably with the rash of activity taking place in high-yield markets overseas, like the U.K., As well as in U.S. Equities. But according to the Merrill Lynch economists, there are signs the pall hanging over the U.S. Bond market is lifting a bit. \"Customer activity has been light, but all on the buy-side, and there is a marked absence of selling,\" they said in a weekly report. Philip Braverman of Irving Trust Securities Inc believes banks will snap up the two- and four-year issues at this week\\'s sales. \"The banks are in need of investments that provide earnings. Though the yield spread to the cost of carrying these maturities has been wider, it is still positive,\" he said in a weekly market review. But economists agreed not even the auctions will generate enough impetus for a major move. This will only come once the overseas markets have had their run. \"Based on last week\\'s events, there is little to indicate that the appetite for yield has begun to wane,\" said economists at Salomon Brothers Inc. Indeed, talk persisted last week that Japanese investors are planning to re-weight their portfolios in favour of the higher-yielding markets at the start of Japan\\'s new fiscal year on April 1. And while traditionally the Japanese have not been big buyers of the shorter-dated issues on offer at this week\\'s U.S. Auctions, such reports undermine market confidence. Even actions by the British, Australian and Canadian monetary authorities to curb the rise of their currencies should also enhance the attractiveness of their respective bond markets, the Salomon Brothers\\' economists said. Meanwhile, ecomomic releases are unlikely to enliven the U.S. Market unless they deviate widely from expectations, economists said. This week\\'s economic calendar begins on Tuesday with February durable goods orders. Economists expect a rebound from January\\'s depressed levels. Peter Greenbaum of Smith, Barney, Harris Upham and Co said several areas, including transport equipment, should have bounced back. But a decline in military capital goods will cap total new orders. He forecasts a rise of two pct after January\\'s 6.7 pct slump. Some other economists foresee a gain as large as five pct. Friday\\'s consumer price report for February is expected to show an increase of about 0.3 pct after a 0.7 pct January gain. Economists said energy prices -- the driving force behind the January rise -- rose more moderately last month, while food prices declined. Meanwhile, economists warned that the federal funds rate will be subject to volatility in the weeks ahead due to the approach of quarter-end and the mid-April tax date. Some economists expect the Fed to execute a bill pass this week because its adding requirement increases sharply in the new statement period beginning on Thursday. Fed funds traded at 6-1/16 pct late Friday and are expected to open near that level. BUNDESBANK SETS NEW REPURCHASE TENDER The Bundesbank set a new tender for a 28-day securities repurchase agreement, offering banks liquidity aid at a fixed rate of 3.80 pct, a central bank spokesman said. Banks must make their bids by 1000 GMT tomorrow, and funds allocated will be credited to accounts on Wednesday. Banks must repurchase securities pledged on April 22. U.K. MONEY MARKET DEFICIT FORECAST AT 800 MLN STG The Bank of England said it forecast a shortage of around 800 mln stg in the money market today. Among the main factors affecting liquidity, bills maturing in official hands and the take-up of treasury bills will drain around 1.18 billion stg while bankers balances below target will take out some 20 mln stg. Partly offseting these outflows, a fall in note circulation and exchequer transactions will add some 355 and 55 mln stg to the system respectively. JAPAN ECONOMY SEEN GROWING 3.6 PCT IN 1987/88 Japan is expected to post a 3.6 pct rise in real gross national product in 1987/88, higher than the official 3.5 pct target, a private economic institute said. The Research Institute on National Economy said in a report the economy will start picking up in the April-June quarter, partly because of an improvement in earnings performance and capital spending in manufacturing industries. The institute assumed an average exchange rate in the year starting April 1 of 150 yen to the dollar. It predicted the Bank of Japan will not change the official discount rate in the year. The institute forecast that Japan\\'s exports will gradually rise in the year in volume terms as the dollar\\'s fall in the past 18 months is likely to help prop up the U.S. Economy. Japan\\'s trade surplus is expected to narrow slightly to 90.2 billion dlrs in 1987/88 ending March 31 from an estimated 98 billion in the current fiscal year, it said. BANK OF FRANCE SAYS NO MONEY MARKET TENDER TODAY The Bank of France will not hold a money market intervention tender today, ruling out a further cut in its 7-3/4 pct intervention rate, central bank sources said. At the tenders, depending on market conditions, the Bank injects liquidity into the market by buying up first category paper. But market sources said that while the recent franc performance leaves room for a further quarter point cut in the intervention rate there was plenty of market liquidity. The Bank cut its rate to 7-3/4 pct from eight pct on March 9, the first change since January 2. Interest rates also fell the same week in Britain, Belgium and Italy. U.K. MONEY MARKET SHORTAGE FORECAST REVISED DOWN The Bank of England said it revised down its forecast of the deficit in the money market today to 750 mln stg from 800 mln. BAKER DENIES DOLLAR TARGET EXISTS U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker again said the meeting of six major industrial nations in Paris last month did not establish a target exchange rate for the dollar. Baker said in a television interview aired here yesterday: \"We don\\'t have a target for the dollar.\" He declined to comment on what might be a desired level for the dollar, saying: \"We really don\\'t talk about the dollar.\" He said protectionism was becoming \"extremely strong\" in the U.S. In response to widening U.S. Trade deficits and import barriers in other countries. \"The mood in the United States is extremely disturbing.

Baker said it would be necessary for other countries to adjust their currencies upwards, as well as remove their barriers to U.S. Imports. But he did not elaborate or name any countries. U.K. MONEY MARKET GIVEN 97 MLN STG ASSISTANCE The Bank of England said it provided the money market with help of 97 mln stg in the morning session. This compares with the Bank\\'s revised estimate of a 750 mln stg shortage in the system today. The central bank bought bank bills outright comprising 12 mln stg in band one at 9-7/8 pct and 85 mln stg in band two at 9-13/16 pct. SWISS SIGHT DEPOSITS RISE 743.7 MLN FRANCS Sight deposits of commercial banks at the Swiss National Bank rose 743.7  mln Swiss francs in the second 10 days of March to 8.40 billion, the National Bank said. Foreign exchange reserves fell 392.1 mln francs to 33.55 billion. Sight deposits are a major indicator of money market liquidity in Switzerland. NIGERIA CHANGES AUCTION RULES TO DEFEND NAIRA Nigeria\\'s Central Bank has changed the rules governing its foreign exchange auctions in what analysts see as a means of defending the naira currency, which has depreciated steadily. The bank said in a statement that from April 2, banks bidding for foreign exchange would have to pay at the rate they offered and not, as presently, at the rate of the lowest successful bid made at the auction. This should discourage banks from bidding high to ensure that they were successful while paying the lower \"marginal\" rate, analysts said. The Central Bank also announced the auctions would be fortnightly, not weekly, beginning on April 2. U.K. MONEY MARKET GIVEN FURTHER 485 MLN STG HELP The Bank of England said it had given the money market a further 485 mln stg assistance in the afternoon session. This takes the Bank\\'s total help so far today to 582 mln stg and compares with its forecast of a 750 mln stg shortage in the system today. The central bank bought bank bills outright comprising 345 mln stg in band one at 9-7/8 pct and 75 mln stg in band two at 9-3/16 pct. It also purchased 65 mln stg of treasury bills in band one at 9-7/8 pct. FED EXPECTED TO SET CUSTOMER REPURCHASES The Federal Reserve is expected to intervene in the government securities market to add temporary reserves indirectly via 1.5 to 2.5 billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreements, economists said. They said that while the Fed has only a moderate add need over the next few days, it will probably intervene in an attempt to counteract an elevated federal funds rate. Fed funds, which averaged 6.09 pct on Friday, opened at 6-3/16 pct and remained at that level in early trading. U.S. TREASURY\\'S BAKER SAYS CURRENCIES WITHIN RANGES THAT BETTER REFLECT FUNDAMENTALS U.S. TREASURY\\'S BAKER SAYS CURRENCIES WITHIN RANGES THAT BETTER REFLECT FUNDAMENTALS CURRENCIES BETTER REFLECT FUNDAMENTALS - BAKER Treasury Secertary James Baker said currencies were now within ranges that better reflected economic fundamentals. In a speech to the annual meeting of the Inter-American Development Bank, he said, \"Excchange have moved into ranges that better reflect economic fundamentals.\" He noted that in particular that dollar has fallen from its high point in early 1985 helping to moderate protectionist pressures in the U.S. CHICAGO FUTURES LEADER SAYS MARKETS CAN ADAPT Foreign currency futures markets would not be harmed if the leading industrial countries agreed to restrict currency movements to within a narrow band, said Leo Melamed, chairman of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange\\'s, CME, executive committee. \"The target zone would not affect our market I think at all.... A 10 pct range in the Deutsche mark gives us a healthy market,\" Melamed told Reuters in an interview. \"We were willing to live in the old Smithsonian era with a four pct shift,\" he said, referring to permitted currency fluctuations in the early 1970s. \"One thing you can adjust is to make each contract a larger value.\" As chairman of the CME in 1969-71, Melamed was instrumental in the development of currency futures, which now are crucial to the Chicago exchange. Melamed said capital flows -- which he estimated can approach 200 billion dlrs a day -- would overwhelm efforts by governments to control currency fluctuations. \"They can do it for a day, in terms of intervention, an hour, a week maybe, but not over a period of time. So it\\'s unrealistic and it doesn\\'t work and it\\'s unnecessary.\" The CME\\'s top policymaker also said a decision by the exchange to advance the quarterly settlement time of its stock index futures contract to the morning from the afternoon would help eliminate dramatic price gyrations in futures and equity markets on so-called \"triple-witching\" day. \"We think that the settlement in the morning will have a salutary effect so that over a longer period of time I think this issue (triple witching) will go away because of the change in the structure as of next June,\" when the move is scheduled to go into effect, he said. Melamed said proposed changes in floor practices by traders of the popular Standard and Poor\\'s 500 stock index future would address complaints of trading abuses and stimulate trading. Two weeks ago, the CME board of directors proposed barring brokers on the top step of the pit from trading for their own account. The board also proposed requiring brokers engaged in dual trading elsewhere in the pit to record personal trades to the nearest minute and curbing trading between broker groups. The changes \"will in time have an extremely positive effect on the marketplace. That\\'s going to prove very, very instrumental in increasing volume over time,\" he said, predicting the increase would come within a year. Melamed, also chairman of Dellsher Investment Co Inc, said the CME last week withdrew a proposal to put a 12-point limit on the S and P 500 index\\'s daily price movement when the Commodity Futures Trading Commission told the exchange it could not be a temporary program. The CME also received \"many negative comments, many more than we anticipated,\" Melamed conceded. Many futures commission merchants predicted sell orders would accelerate in the event the price approached the bottom limit. U.K. PROFITTED FROM AUTUMN INTERVENTION - LAWSON Britain has reaped profits by using a stronger pound to buy back dollars used by the government last autumn to support sterling during a currency crisis, Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said. He said in a parliamentary debate, \"I can now tell the House (of Commons) that the dollars that were sold from the reserves in September and October (1986) have subsequently all been repurchased - at a profit of some tens of millions of pounds.\" Hindsight had proved him right to resist market pressures then for a two percentage point interest rate rise, he said. The increase in base rates was instead limited then to one point. During a debate on the 1987/88 British budget which Lawson unveiled last week, he said that \"during the period of foreign exchange market turbulence which followed the somewhat inconclusive Group of Five and Group of Seven meetings at the end of September, I authorised the Bank of England to intervene unusually heavily in order to buy breathing space that would enable me to confine the interest rate rise to one pct rather than the two pct the market was then pressing for.\" He said that that one percentage point increase, effected in October 1986, had been reversed by this month\\'s two half point cuts in banks\\' base lending rates. They are now at 10 pct. Treasury figures show that the underlying change in British reserves - seen as a guide to possible Bank of England intervention on foreign exchange markets - suggest that the authorities sold around 1.0 billion dlrs during September and October 1986, government sources said. Dollar hits record low of 149.78 yen - Tokyo dealers Dollar hits record low of 149.78 yen - Tokyo dealers TOKYO - Bank of Japan buys small amount of dollars, dealers said TOKYO - Bank of Japan buys small amount of dollars, dealers said Miyazawa says time has come for major nations to act on exchange rates Miyazawa says time has come for major nations to act on exchange rates MAJOR NATIONS MUST ACT ON CURRENCIES - MIYAZAWA Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said the time has come for major industrialised nations to take action on exchange rates in line with their agreement last month in Paris. In Paris, Britain, Canada, France, Japan, the U.S. And West Germany agreed to coooperate to hold currency rates around their then current levels. Miyazawa would not say what specific measures major nations would take, but told reporters the measures had been discussed in Paris. The dollar fell to a record low against the yen this morning, piercing the 150 yen barrier. BANK OF JAPAN RE-ENTERS MARKET AND STEPS UP DOLLAR BUYING, DEALERS SAY BANK OF JAPAN RE-ENTERS MARKET AND STEPS UP DOLLAR BUYING, DEALERS SAY BANK OF JAPAN STEPS UP DOLLAR BUYING The Bank of Japan stepped up its dollar buying as it re-entered the market after the midday Tokyo lunch break, dealers said. They said the bank seemed more determined to support the dollar than it did this morning. Several dealers said the central bank intervened this afternoon when the dollar stood around 149 yen. One said it purchased 150 to 200 mln dlrs in the half-hour since the market re-opened after its lunchtime closure. Another said the bank still has buying orders in the market. TAIWAN COMPLAINS ABOUT SIZE OF RESERVES Taiwan\\'s foreign exchange reserves, swollen by strong trade surpluses to a record 53 billion U.S. Dlrs, are becoming a problem, government officials said. Official figures show the latest level compares with the previous record of 51 billion dlrs on March 4 and about 26 billion in late March 1986. Central bank Governor Chang Chi-cheng told reporters the increase in reserves was the result of heavy intervention by the bank on the local interbank market. It bought nearly two billion U.S. Dlrs between March 5 and 23, he said. Wang Chao-ming, vice chairman of the government\\'s Council for Economic Planning and Development, told Reuters the rising reserves were \"a big headache for Taiwan.\" He said the government expects heavier pressure from the U.S., Where protectionist bills are being proposed against nations such as Taiwan and Japan with large trade surpluses with the U.S. Wang said the government would launch new measures within the next two months to further reduce import tariffs and open the market wider to foreign products, especially those from the U.S. Wang said the measures aim at helping reduce Taiwan\\'s trade surplus, which rose to 2.73 billion U.S. Dlrs in the first two months of 1987 from 2.02 billion a year earlier. Nearly 90 pct of the surplus was with the U.S. Vice Economic Minister Wang Chien-shien agreed with Wang\\'s remarks and said efforts to avert U.S. Protectionism were running out of time. \"We must do it quickly or face retaliation from Washington,\" he said. He said the measures would include removal of trade barriers on insurance and inland services for U.S. Companies. Chang Chi-cheng said the central bank could not stop buying U.S. Dollars because of heavy sales by local exporters who fear the strong local dollar will cause them exchange losses. He said the bank is studying revision of the foreign exchange rules in hope of further reducing currency controls, but declined to give details. The Taiwan dollar has risen about 15 pct against the U.S. Dollar since September 1985. It opened at 34.38 to the U.S. Dollar today and is expected to rise further to 33 in June and to 32 by end-year, some foreign bankers said. Sumita says Bank of Japan will intervene if necessary Sumita says Bank of Japan will intervene if necessary SUMITA SAYS BANK WILL INTERVENE IF NECESSARY Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita said in a statement the central bank will intervene in foreign exchange markets to stabilise exchange rates if necessary in close cooperation with other major industrial nations. Sumita said the Bank will take adequate measures including market intervention, if necessary, in line with the February 22 Paris agreement by six major industrial nations. Canada, Britain, France, Japan, the U.S. And West Germany agreed to cooperate in stabilising exchange rates around current levels. Sumita\\'s statement was issued after the dollar slipped below 150 yen to hit a record low of 148.40. \"It is inevitable that exchange rates fluctuate under the system of floating rates,\" Sumita said. The fact the dollar plunged below 150 yen does not mean anything significant under the floating system, he said. The six nations agreed in Paris exchange rates prevailing then were broadly consistent with underlying economic fundamentals and further substantial rate shifts could damage growth and adjustment prospects in their countries, the Paris statement said. DOUBTS ABOUT ACCORD SEEN WEAKENING DOLLAR FURTHER The dollar is expected to decline further in coming days as scepticism mounts about the effectiveness of last month\\'s Paris accord to stabilise currency exchange rates, senior foreign exchange dealers said. Following its fall today to a record 148.40 yen, dealers said they expect the dollar to establish a new trading range of 147 to 150 yen before the market again tries to push it down. Behind the latest dollar fall lies the belief that last month\\'s accord was no longer enough to stop operators pushing the dollar down, the dealers said. \"The recent remark by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker that the Paris accord did not set any target ranges for major currencies has cast a shadow on the agreement,\" said Koji Kidokoro, general manager of Mitsui Bank Ltd\\'s treasury division. He said the market interpreted this as indicating the U.S. Would favour a weaker dollar and it had little intention of intervening to support the currency. \"This eliminated the widespread market caution against possible joint central bank intervention,\" Kidokoro said. Dealers said the dollar had gathered renewed downward momentum and that Bank of Japan intervention alone could hardly contain a further slide in the currency. They said the central bank bought between one to 1.5 billion dlrs today, including direct purchases through brokers, and yesterday it might have bought a small amount of dollars through the U.S. Central bank in New York. Most dealers said they doubted the U.S. Federal Reserve would intervene on its own account to support the dollar, but some said this might occur if the dollar fell much below 148 yen. \"If the dollar drops to that low level, it could reduce the flow of foreign capital into U.S. Securities, which the Americans don\\'t want,\" said Haruya Uehara, chief money market manager of Mitsubishi Trust and Banking Corp. He said the dollar may return to around 152 yen next month when corporations reduce their dollar sales after they close their books for the 1986/87 business year ending on March 31. But dealers said the longer-term outlook for the dollar remained bearish. This was due to the lacklustre performance of the U.S. Economy, the continuing U.S. Trade deficit and Japanese delays in announcing an economic stimulation package. \"The Americans are getting frustrated at Japan\\'s inertia in stimulating its economy,\" said Hirozumi Tanaka, assistant general manager of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd\\'s international treasury division. In the Paris currency accord Japan promised a package of economic measures, after the fiscal 1987 budget was passed, to boost domestic demand, increase imports, and thus reduce its trade surplus. The package was expected in April, but debate on the budget has been delayed by an opposition boycott of parliamentary business over the proposed introduction of a sales tax. In the circumstances the government had only a slim chance of producing a meaningful economic package in the near future, Dai-Ichi Kangyo\\'s Tanaka said. Dealers said if steps are not taken to stimulate the Japanese economy protectionist sentiment in the U.S. Congress would grow and put more downward pressure on the dollar. U.K. MONEY MARKET DEFICIT FORECAST AT 300 MLN STG The Bank of England said it forecast a shortage of around 300 mln stg in the money market today. Among the main factors affecting liquidity, bills maturing in official hands and the take-up of treasury bills will drain some 338 mln stg while bankers\\' balances below target will take out around 25 mln stg. Partly offsetting these outflows, a fall in note circulation and exchequer transactions will add some 45 mln stg and 25 mln stg to the system respectively. MIYAZAWA SAYS U.S. LIKELY TO INTERVENE Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told Parliament\\'s Lower House Finance Committee that the U.S. Is expected to intervene in the foreign exchange market to stabilise exchange rates, political sources said. Asked if the U.S. Federal Reserve Board agreed in Paris last month to intervene to stabilise exchange rates, Miyazawa said yes, the sources said. Miyazawa was also quoted as saying that he is sceptical about the effectiveness of currency reference ranges even if major nations agree on such an idea as it is extremely difficult to set such ranges. BANK OF JAPAN STEPS UP DOLLAR BUYING The Bank of Japan stepped up its dollar buying as it re-entered the market after the midday Tokyo lunch break, dealers said.

MAJOR NATIONS MUST ACT ON CURRENCIES - MIYAZAWA Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said the time has come for major industrialised nations to take action on exchange rates in line with their agreement last month in Paris. In Paris, Britain, Canada, France, Japan, the U.S. And West Germany agreed to coooperate to hold currency rates around their then current levels. Miyazawa would not say what specific measures major nations would take, but told reporters the measures had been discussed in Paris. The dollar fell to a record low against the yen this morning, piercing the 150 yen barrier. Asked if major nations were now negotiating on what measures to take, Miyazawa said they were not as measures had already been agreed in Paris. MIYAZAWA SAYS U.S. LIKELY TO INTERVENE Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told Parliament\\'s Lower House Finance Committee that the U.S. Is expected to intervene in the foreign exchange market to stabilise exchange rates, political sources said. Asked if the U.S. Federal Reserve Board agreed in Paris last month to intervene to stabilise exchange rates, Miyazawa said yes, the sources said. Miyazawa was also quoted as saying that he is sceptical about the effectiveness of currency reference ranges even if major nations agree on such an idea as it is extremely difficult to set such ranges. U.K. MONEY MARKET GIVEN 115 MLN STG ASSISTANCE The Bank of England said it had provided the money market with 115 mln stg assistance in the morning session. This compares with the Bank\\'s forecast of a 300 mln stg shortage in the system today. The central bank bought bills outright in band two at 9-13/16 pct comprising 73 mln stg bank bills and 42 mln stg local authority bills. SUMITA SAYS BANK WILL INTERVENE IF NECESSARY Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita said in a statement the central bank will intervene in foreign exchange markets to stabilise exchange rates if necessary in close cooperation with other major industrial nations. Sumita said the Bank will take adequate measures including market intervention, if necessary, in line with the February 22 Paris agreement by six major industrial nations. Canada, Britain, France, Japan, the U.S. And West Germany agreed to cooperate in stabilising exchange rates around current levels.

The fact the dollar plunged below 150 yen does not mean anything significant under the floating system, he said. The six nations agreed in Paris exchange rates prevailing then were broadly consistent with underlying economic fundamentals and further substantial rate shifts could damage growth and adjustment prospects in their countries, the Paris statement said. DOLLAR DROP SEEN AS TEST OF PARIS AGREEMENT The sharp drop in the value of the dollar against the yen and the mark is the first serious test of last month\\'s Group of Five (G-5) plus Canada agreement to stabilise currencies, dealers and bank economists said. \"The dollar will be pushed down until there is coordinated central bank intervention,\" one dealer for a German bank said, echoing widepread sentiment in the market. But opinion was divided on whether the united front forged in Paris still exists. Some dealers said there were growing signs the United States wanted the dollar to fall further. Despite repeated Bank of Japan intervention, the dollar plunged to a post-war low in Tokyo today. It was quoted as low as 148.40 yen in the Far East and dealers here said they expected the U.S. Currency to decline further. \"The dollar is now firmly within a broad 140 to 150 yen range,\" Chase Bank AG\\'s senior dealer Eckhart Hager said. Others said there were technical reasons for the sharp dollar drop. \"Window-dressing\" operations by some Japanese companies who were selling dollars and buying yen before the end of the Japanese fiscal year on March 31 were undermining the U.S. Currency. Dealers said main reason for the sell-off was not technical. U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker\\'s comment the Paris accord did not have fixed dollar targets was seen as a renewed attempt by the U.S. Administration to talk the dollar down. \"Suddenly, support levels which had existed for fear of central bank intervention disappeared,\" one dealer said. The Bank of Japan was believed to have bought some 1.5 billion dlrs, and this with comments by Japanese officials indicated Tokyo was unhappy about the plunge, dealers said. Bank of Japan governor Satoshi Sumita threatened central bank intervention if necessary. Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said today the time had come for the six nations who agreed in Paris last month to stabilise currencies - Japan, Britain, Canada, France, the U.S. And West Germany - to take action in line with the pact. But the Bundesbank and other European central banks were not detected in the open market during the European morning. Opinion here was divided on when the Bundesbank would act. While some said the West German central bank would support the dollar once it fell below 1.80 marks, others said the Bundesbank would only intervene after a fall below 1.75 marks or if the decline accelerated. The Bundesbank last intervened on January 27, when the dollar threatened to fall below 1.81 marks. \"The Japanese seem to be on their own at the moment,\" one dealer said. Others said cooperation between central banks and governments was easier said than done. Some said Baker\\'s remarks and U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter\\'s warning that the U.S. And Japan were on the verge of a serious trade conflict showed there was a rift. \"It\\'s hard to tell whether the G-6 agreement still stands,\" a dealer said. Another added, \"If the Americans do not get what they want, they will push the dollar down, regardless of G-6.\" Citibank AG also cast doubt on the chances of success for the Paris agreement in its latest investment letter. \"It is hard to see that Japan and Germany are willing or able to loosen fiscal policy sufficiently to offset the necessary U.S. Fiscal contraction,\" Citibank said. It added, \"Markets should therefore be aware that 1.80 marks is not the lower limit for the dollar -- a rate of 1.70 marks or even less is expected this year.\" And London Broker Hoare Govett said in its March 1987 economic report, \"We are looking for a further, more gradual, fall, possibly to 1.60 marks by the end of the year.\" But opinion about whether the Paris accord was still in force was not universal. Some dealers said not too much should be read into Baker\\'s and Yeutter\\'s comments. \"There is no reason to believe the Paris pact has broken down,\" a senior dealer said. JAPANESE ECONOMIST SEES STABLE YEN/DOLLAR RATES The yen should stabilize at around 152 to 153 to the U.S. Dollar for about a year, the Bank of Tokyo\\'s economic adviser Koei Narusawa said. \"Both sides are showing clear interest to secure stability of the currencies. The major target of the Japanese government is to maintain the yen at above 150, at least for the rest of the year,\" he told reporters during a brief visit to Malaysia. Narusawa said the U.S. Is unlikely to push the yen up further because this might spark off inflation and depress the U.S. Economy before the 1988 presidential election. The yen is trading at around 153.70 to the dollar. SPAIN RAISES CALL MONEY RATES ON HIGHER DEMAND The Bank of Spain raised overnight call money rates by 1/4 to 14 pct on demand for 746 billion pesetas in today\\'s auction, which a bank spokesman termed \"heavy.\" Rates stood at 12.1 pct at the start of the year and have been increased to drain liquidity on rising demands for funds, the spokesman said. He said in reply to Reuters inquiries that rates could rise further if money supply growth rose above this year\\'s eight pct target for M-4, defined as liquid assets in public hands. Money supply rose at an annualised rate of 16.7 pct last month against 8.1 pct in January. Growth was 11.4 pct in 1986. A leading Spanish broker said the central bank was applying a more restrictive policy to keep the lid on inflation. The consumer price index rose 8.3 pct last year. \"Money supply control is the government\\'s chief weapon against inflation,\" he said. \"The problem is higher rates are attracting liquidity from abroad.\" He said this was why the central bank enacted specific measures to control the inflow of foreign capital. The Bank of Spain earlier this month imposed a 19 pct reserve requirement on new convertible peseta funds held by banks to curb short-term speculative capital from abroad. U.K. MONEY MARKET GIVEN FURTHER 104 MLN STG HELP The Bank of England said it provided the money market with assistance of 104 mln stg in the afternoon session. This takes the bank\\'s total help so far today to 219 mln stg and compares with its estimate of a 300 mln stg shortage. The central bank bought outright 104 mln stg in bank bills in band two at 9-13/16 pct. N.Y. DEALERS BELIEVE FED INTERVENED TO BUY DLRS The Federal Reserve appears to have intervened in the U.S. foreign exchange market to buy dollars against yen this morning, currency dealers said. They said the intervention occurred near the dollar\\'s early low of 148.50 yen and the U.S. currency subsequently firmed to 149.05/15. It closed at 150.00/05 on Monday. Dealers were uncertain of the amount involved and whether the Fed\\'s purchases were for its own account or for a customer. But there was speculation that it may have been done in conjunction with the Bank of Japan. Tokyo dealers said the Japanese central bank bought dollars in Tokyo earlier today. U.K. MONEY MARKET GIVEN 10 MLN STG LATE ASSISTANCE The Bank of England said it provided the money market with late help of about 10 mln stg. This takes the bank\\'s total help today to some 229 mln stg and compares with its forecast of a 300 mln stg shortage. SUDAN REJECTS IMF DEMAND FOR DEVALUATION Sudan has rejected a demand by the International Monetary Fund for a currency devaluation because such a move would have a negative impact on its economy, the official Sudan News Agency (SUNA) reported. Finance Minister Beshir Omer, quoted by SUNA, said his government also rejected an IMF demand to lift state subsidies on basic consumer goods. SUNA, monitored by the British Broadcasting Corporation, said Omer made the remarks after a meeting in Khartoum yesterday with IMF envoy Abdel-Shakour Shaalan. Sudan, burdened by a foreign debt of 10.6 billion dlrs, is some 500 mln dlrs in arrears to the IMF, which declared it ineligible for fresh loans in February last year. In February 1985, Sudan announced a 48 pct devaluation of its pound against the dollar, adjusting the official exchange rate to 2.5 pounds to the U.S. Currency. Since then, it has resisted pressure from main creditors for more currency adjustments, arguing that past devaluations had failed to boost exports but raised local consumer prices. Sudan also has an incentive rate of four pounds to the dollar for foreign visitors and remittances by expatriate workers. Dealers in Khartoum\\'s thriving black market said the dollar was sold at 5.5 pounds today. With stringent import regulations and the government increasingly short of foreign currency, black market dollars are used to finance smuggled imports from neighbouring countries, mainly Egypt, Kenya, Ethiopia and Zaire. Western diplomats in Khartoum say the meetings between IMF and Sudanese government officials do not amount to formal talks, but rather an effort by the IMF to monitor Sudan\\'s economic performance. The diplomats said Sudan hoped a planned four-year economic recovery program would be acceptable to the IMF as a serious attempt to tackle the country\\'s economic troubles and persuade its Gulf Arab creditors to pay the IMF arrears. This, they said, could provide Sudan with a clean bill of health from the IMF that it could take to Western government creditors, grouped informally in the so-called Paris Club, to reschedule debt payments. Twenty-three pct of Sudan\\'s total foreign debt is owed to members of the Paris Club, the diplomats said. Sudan\\'s Finance Minister said last month the country\\'s IMF representative had told him the fund\\'s executive board was \"very pleased with the 18.5 mln dlrs arrears we have paid in the past couple of months.\" The representative, Omer Said, said IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus said he would ask Saudi Arabia, to which Sudan owes about 1.4 billion dlrs, to help Khartoum to pay more. Sudan has an annual debt liability of nearly 900 mln dlrs but set aside only some 200 mln dlrs to service debts in the fiscal year ending next June 30. FED GOVERNOR SUPPORTS COMMODITY PRICE GUIDE Robert Heller, a member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, said commodity prices could form a useful guide for setting domestic and international monetary policy. Speaking to the conservative Heritage Foundation, Heller said, \"A broadly based commodity price index may be worth exploring\" as a guide to monetary policy. \"In times of rising commodity prices, monetary policy might be tightened and in times of falling commodity prices, monetary policy might be eased,\" he said. Commodities are also standardized to avoid measurement problems and occur at the beginning of production so as to give \"early warning\" signs of wholesale and retail changes. \"There is no need to react to every small fluctuation in commodity prices or to do so on a daily basis,\" Heller said in a prepared text. \"But if commodity prices exhibit a broad trend, a policy action might be considered,\" he said. Heller said using a broad-based commodity price index as an indicator for monetary policy would also contribute to stabilized currency exchange rates. Commodity prices are generally uniform worldwide and prices for them are more consistent than for other types of goods, he said. He said other beneficial effects would be to stabilize export commodity prices for developing countries by using a commodity basket as a guidepost for monetary policy. STERLING OUTLOOK CLOUDED BY TEST OF PARIS ACCORD The move by foreign exchange markets to test the strength of the Paris currency accord has thrown into question the near-term outlook for sterling, until recently one of the main beneficiaries of the agreement, analysts said. Since the six-nation accord last month, sterling has risen sharply, adding almost five pct on its trade-weighted index. While the accord effectively stifled dollar/yen and dollar/mark movements, the markets turned their attention to sterling as foreign investors rushed to take advantage of relatively high U.K. Interest rates. But analysts say the pound has been sidelined by the first tentative test of the Paris accord seen yesterday. The market now looks set sooner or later to push the dollar down further in a test of the willingness of central banks to intervene. Analysts say if the banks do not intervene effectively, the Paris accord could collapse. \"On balance, sterling would be a net sufferer if G-6 collapses,\" Phillips and Drew analyst Stephen Lewis said. He said sterling would lose out as markets turned their attention to capital movements whereas previously they had been restricted to looking only at the interest yield on currencies. However, although most analysts and foreign exchange dealers were forecasting a brief period of consolidation or even retracement for sterling, none were expecting a very sharp drop in the U.K. Currency. Sterling remained supported by optimism on the U.K. Political and economic outlook, firmer oil prices and relatively high interest rates, they said. Bullish sentiment on the U.K. Economic outlook has been running especially high after last week\\'s budget, seen as popular both with the markets and with British voters. Sterling was also supported by signs of a weakening in the West German and Japanese economies, where growth for 1987 is trailing behind the three pct forecast for the U.K. Recent opinion polls showing Britain\\'s ruling conservative party ahead of opposition parties in popularity have also supported the pound. In addition, sterling has so far shrugged off two half-point cuts in U.K. Bank base lending rates in less than two weeks. A further half-point cut, widely expected in the next week or so, has already been largely discounted. U.K. Base rates, now running at 10 pct, are still relatively high compared to other western countries, and analysts said a further base rate cut to 9-1/2 pct was unlikely to affect sterling. Sterling today appeared resilient to the dollar\\'s decline, dropping only slightly on a cross-rate basis. Worries about renewed turbulence in the foreign exchange markets, however, were reflected in the U.K. Government bond (gilt) market, where prices dropped by up to 5/16 point. Until now foreign investor interest in the gilt market has been one of the major reasons behind the rise in sterling. Dealers said they expected the pound to hold quietly steady for the next few days while the market awaits further developments on the dollar and this Thursday\\'s U.K. Current account figures for February. Market forecasts are for a deficit of around 250 mln stg after January\\'s small surplus. FED\\'S HELLER URGES JAPANESE TO BUY U.S. GOODS A member of the Federal Reserve Board, Robert Heller, said he wanted to see stronger Japanese demand for American goods. \"What I was advocating here was more Japanese purchases of American goods,\" Heller said in response to a question about the dollar\\'s weakness in currency markets. He told a Heritage Foundation forum, \"I\\'d be very happy to see that.\" In his formal remarks, Heller said he supported the idea of using commodity prices as an indicator for monetary policy. Asked if he would raise the issue at the next Federal Open Market Committee meeting, he said, \"Even at previous meetings commodity prices were raised.\" He added, \"I would not expect future meetings to be different from past meetings in that respect.\" BALDRIGE SAYS CHANGES NEEDED IN EXCHANGE RATES OF CURRENCIES PEGGED TO DOLLAR BALDRIGE SAYS CHANGES NEEDED IN EXCHANGE RATES OF CURRENCIES PEGGED TO DOLLAR BALDRIGE SUPPORTS NIC TALKS ON CURRENCIES Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige said he supported efforts to persuade newly-industrialized countries (NICS) to revalue currencies that are tied to the dollar in order to help the United States cut its massive trade deficit. \"We do need to do something with those currencies or we will be substituting Japanese products for Taiwanese products,\" or those of other nations with currencies tied to the dollar, Baldrige told a House banking subcommittee. The U.S. dollar has declined in value against the Yen and European currencies, but has changed very little against the currencies of some developing countries such as South Korea and Taiwan because they are linked to the value of the dollar. As a result, efforts to reduce the value of the dollar over the past year and a half have done little to improve the trade deficits with those countries. Baldrige told a House Banking subcommittee that the Treasury Department was attempting to persuade those countries to reach agreement with the United States on exchange rates. DOLLAR EXPECTED TO FALL DESPITE INTERVENTION Central bank intervention in the foreign exchange markets succeeded in staunching the dollar\\'s losses today, but senior dealers here believe the U.S. currency is headed for a further retreat. Although the intervention was widespread, dealers perceive that the six major industrial nations have differing levels of commitment to their recent accord to stabilize currencies. Moreover, hard economic realities hold greater sway over the currency market than central bank intervention and these argue for a further dollar decline, dealers said. \"The market can be bigger than the central banks. And economic fundamentals will always come to the fore,\" said a dealer at one major U.S. bank. As the dollar dropped to post-World War II lows against the yen today foreign exchange traders said the Bank of Japan, Federal Reserve Board and Bank of England intervened in the markets on behalf of the U.S. currency. Reports of the authorities\\' actions helped the dollar recover to about 149.45 yen in New York this afternoon from the post-war low of 148.20 yen in the Far East. But it still failed to regain Monday\\'s U.S. closing level of 150.00/05 yen. Tokyo dealers said the Bank of Japan bought one to 1.5 billion dlrs in Tokyo today and may also have purchased dollars yesterday in the U.S. via the Federal Reserve. Meanwhile, there were strong rumors in New York that the Fed also bought a modest amount of dollars around 148.50 yen today. Talk also circulated that the Bank of England purchased a small amount of dollars for yen. The Fed\\'s last confirmed intervention was on January 28 when it bought 50 mln dlrs in coordination with the Bank of Japan. But on March 11 the Fed also was rumored to have signalled displeasure with a dollar surge above 1.87 marks. The authorities\\' actions appeared to back up the February 22 Paris pact between the U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain, France and Canada under which the nations agreed to cooperate to foster exchange rate stability around prevailing levels. But foreign exchange dealers were not overly impressed by the authorities\\' intervention which they said can only soften extreme moves in the market. For one thing, some dealers believed that the Fed\\'s purchases were done on behalf of the Bank of Japan rather than for the U.S. central bank\\'s own account, suggesting a rather watered-down American commitment to the currency accord. The Bank of England\\'s action also was thought to be completed on behalf of the Japanese central bank, reinforcing the market\\'s view that Japan is the most resolute of the six nations in its support of the currency pact. \"No-one doubts the Bank of Japan is serious. But the other two central banks seem to be making more token gestures than anything else,\" said Chris Bourdain of BankAmerica Corp. \"I\\'m not convinced the intervention was concerted,\" said Earl Johnson of Harris Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago. \"It\\'s a yen problem more than anything else.\" Some dealers said a rising wave of trade protectionist sentiment in the U.S. limits the extent to which the American authorities can endorse a stronger dollar against the yen. \"The dollar\\'s break below the key 150 yen level ties the Treasury\\'s hands behind its back. The U.S. cannot intervene on its own account because of the strength of protectionism here,\" said Albert Soria of Swiss Bank Corp. Such comments reflect the view that the currency markets are becoming increasingly politicized. Despite official denials, some traders still feel the U.S. would countenance a lower dollar to help trim the nation\\'s trade deficit. The majority of the 170 billion dlr merchandise trade deficit in 1986 was with Japan. Indeed U.S. Treasury secretary James Baker\\'s comment on Sunday that the February currency pact had not established dollar targets was read by the market as a signal to sell the U.S. currency and kicked off the latest retreat. \"The dollar still has more room on the downside against the yen based on the frictions in trade and financial services. The currency market is becoming very political,\" said Natsuo Okada of Sumitomo Bank Ltd. Okada expects the dollar to trade between 148 and 150 yen this week but sees the chance of a drop to 140 yen by the end of April or early May. Even if West Germany and Japan succeed in stimulating their economies, it may not be enough to solve structural economic imbalances in the near future, dealers said. \"Even if Japan and West Germany do expand this year, it won\\'t be enough to help the trade situation much,\" said Bourdain of BankAmerica, who also expects the dollar to drop to 148 yen in the next couple of days. PHILIPPINE PLANNING CHIEF URGES PESO DEVALUATION The Philippines must devalue the peso if it wants its exports to remain competitive, Economic Planning Secretary Solita Monsod told Reuters. \"The peso/dollar rate has to be undercut to make our exports more competitive,\" Monsod said an interview. \"No question about it. I\\'m saying you cannot argue with success. Taiwan, South Korea, West Germany, Japan, all those miracle economies deliberately undervalued their currencies.\" The peso has been free-floating since June 1984. It is currently at about 20.50 to the U.S. Dollar. Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin has said the government does not intend to devalue the peso and wants it to be flexible and able to continue to respond to market conditions. Monsod said Ongpin was looking at the exchange rate from the point of view of finance. \"If the dollar rate goes higher, our debt service in terms of pesos gets higher, so the financing is very difficult,\" she said. \"But I am looking at it in terms of the economy.\" She said she was not trying to oppose official policy. \"I\\'m just saying, keep it competitive. I do not want it to become uncompetitive because then we are dead.\" Monsod said, \"The ideal movement in the peso/dollar rate is a movement that will reflect differences in inflation (rates) of the Philippines versus the other country. It\\'s an arithmetic thing.\" Official figures show Philippine inflation averaged 0.8 pct in calendar 1986. Ongpin told reporters on Saturday it was expected to touch five pct this year. He said the government and the International Monetary Fund had set the peso/dollar 1987 target rate at 20.80. The peso lost 22.2 pct in value to slump to 18.002 to the dollar when it was floated in 1984. FED\\'S JOHNSON SAYS DOLLAR STABILIZED AFTER FED TOOK APPROPRIATE ACTION FED\\'S JOHNSON SAYS DOLLAR STABILIZED AFTER FED TOOK APPROPRIATE ACTION FED CHAIRMAN VOLCKER SAYS BANK PROPOSALS A WORRY The chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Paul Volcker, has written to the chairman of the House Banking Committee to raise concerns about legislative proposals scheduled for consideration Wednesday. Volcker told committee chairman Fernand St. Germain a proposal to deny primary dealer status to firms from countries that do not grant U.S. firms equal access to their government debt markets might invite retaliation against U.S. firms abroad. He added, \"even Japan, against whom this proposal seems to be particularly directed,\" has started opening its markets. In his letter, made available at the Treasury, Volcker also said a proposal to ease debt problems of developing countries by setting up a public facility to buy their debts owed to commercial banks, was a problem. \"I believe that the prospect of debt relief would undermine the difficult internal efforts of the borrowing countries to achieve the structural reform that is needed regardless of the policies that are followed on servicing external debt,\" Volcker said. It might also cause private lenders to become reluctant to extend more credit to the borrowing countries, he said. Volcker said he endorsed comments by Treasury Secretary James Baker \"about the inappropriateness of using public resources for purchasing private commercial bank debt, which we both see as an inherent aspect of the proposed international debt facility.\" He also said a proposal for establishing formal procedures for international negotiations on currency exchange rates \"is unrealistic and could well have damaging effects.\" \"For example, the bill\\'s directive to intitiate negotiations in order to achieve a competitive exchange rate for the dollar -- a matter upon which there can be considerable difference among analysts -- runs the risk of building up potentially destabilizing market expectations,\" Volcker said. He recommended \"we should not lock ourselves into formalized procedures for international negotiations\" on exchange rates but instead use other, more flexible means like the recent mmeting in Paris between U.S. treasury and central bank representatives and those of major trade allies. FED\\'S JOHNSON SAYS FED ACTED TO STABILIZE DOLLAR Federal Reserve Board Vice Chairman Manuel Johnson said the dollar has stabilized against other currencies after action taken by the Fed. \"We have taken the appropriate action and the dollar has stabilized,\" Johnson said after testifying to a House Banking subcommittee. He did not elaborate on the nature of the action nor when it was taken, but said that it was in the spirit of the agreement reached by six industrial nations in Paris recently. Johnson said the dollar\\'s decline against other currencies such as the Japanese yen has been gradual. Since the accord by the United States, Britain, West Germany, Japan, France and Canada, foreign exchange markets have been closely watching for indications of intervention by central banks to determine the committment by those nations to their agreement. The nations agreed that currency exchange rates were at about the correct levels when the pact was signed earlier this year. VOLCKER CALLS DOLLAR SLIDE ENOUGH Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker said that the dollar\\'s slide in currency markets has been enough, a Fed spokesman said. The spokesman confirmed that Volcker, who spoke to a group of financial analysts, said in answer to a question about the dollar\\'s recent slide that \"enough is enough.\" Volcker has often expressed concern about the dollar falling too rapidly in currency markets. Bank of Japan bought 200 to 300 mln dlrs this morning, dealers said. Bank of Japan bought 200 to 300 mln dlrs this morning, dealers said. JAPAN BUYS MODEST AMOUNT OF DOLLARS, DEALERS SAY The Bank of Japan bought a modest amount of dollars this morning, possibly around 200 to 300 mln, dealers said. One dealer said the central bank bought about 200 mln dlrs through brokers and the rest through banks. The buying began when the dollar was at about 149.60 yen, and helped drive the U.S. Currency up to around 150, he said. Another said the central bank seemed to be trying to push the dollar up above 150 yen. But heavy selling at around that level quickly pushed the dollar back down towards 149 yen, dealers said. Bank of Japan keeps intervening to hold dollar above 149 yen, brokers Bank of Japan keeps intervening to hold dollar above 149 yen, brokers JAPAN INTERVENING TO KEEP DOLLAR UP, BROKERS The Bank of Japan is continuing to intervene in the Tokyo market, buying small amounts of dollars to hold the unit above 149 yen, brokers said. They said the Bank is coming in when the dollar is around 149.05/10 yen, the same levels as New York\\'s close yesterday and the midday close in Tokyo today. Dealers said the Bank of Japan is intervening in the market through both banks and brokers this afternoon. The central bank is checking selling orders through banks and placing matching buy orders, they said. The central bank started to intervene shortly after the market opened here in the afternoon, the dealers said. U.K. MONEY MARKET DEFICIT FORECAST AT 350 MLN STG The Bank of England said it forecast a shortage of around 350 mln stg in the money market today. Among the main factors affecting liquidity, bills maturing in official hands and the take-up of treasury bills will drain some 525 mln stg while bankers\\' balnces below target will take out around 175 mln stg. Partly offsetting these outflows, exchequer transactions and a fall in note circulation will add some 300 mln stg and 40 mln stg to the system respectively. Current exchange rates almost within levels agreed by major nations - Sumita Current exchange rates almost within levels agreed by major nations - Sumita Sumita says major nations cooperated to stabilise currencies. Sumita says major nations cooperated to stabilise currencies. EXCHANGE RATES ALMOST WITHIN G-6 LEVELS - SUMITA Bank of Japan governor Satoshi Sumita said that current exchange rates are almost within the levels agreed to by six major nations last month in Paris. Asked whether a dollar/yen rate of 148 or 149 reflected economic fundamentals, he said current rates almost reflect fundamentals. Sumita told reporters major nations have cooperated to bring about currency stability in line with the Paris agreement, which stipulated that they would closely cooperate to that end. He repeated the central bank will intervene if necessary, adding he did not think a dollar free-fall was likely. But Sumita said he could not say exactly what currency levels would be considered in line with underlying economic fundamentals. In Paris on February 22, Britain, Canada, France, Japan, the U.S. And West Germany agreed to cooperate to hold currencies around their then current levels. Sumita said he could not find any specific reasons behind the fall of the dollar to a record low against the yen yesterday. But he said the market rushed to sell dollars as it nervously reacted to statements abroad and to developments surrounding trade tensions. U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker said over the weekend that the Paris pact did not encompass fixed tragets for the dollar. U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter called U.S/Japan relations on certain key trade issues very strained. The market reacted nervously because the dollar has been moving narrowly against the yen since mid-January, Sumita said. He added he does not expect the yen/dollar exchange rate to remain unstable because the market is concerned about a sharp rise of the yen. The Bank of Japan will keep a close watch on exchange rates in line with the Paris accord, he added. JAPAN DOES NOT INTEND TO CUT DISCOUNT RATE-SUMITA Bank of Japan governor Satoshi Sumita said the central bank has no intention of cutting its discount rate again as a way of preventing the yen\\'s rise. He told a press conference that the growth of Japanese money supply remains high. The bank will have to watch closely various developments resulting from its already eased monetary stance, such as the sharp rise in real estate and stock prices, he said. Although the yen\\'s rise will have a greater deflationary impact on the economy, the economy is not likely to slow down much further, Sumita said. \"I don\\'t think we should change our economic outlook at the moment,\" Sumita said. Sumita has said in the past that he expects the economy to show a gradual upturn in the second half of the year. The governor said the six major industrial nations are expected to review last month\\'s pact on currency stability when they meet next in April. Dealers said they expect the six - Britain, Canada, France, Japan, the U.S. Amd West Germany - to meet just before the IMF/World Bank interim committee meeting in Washington starting on April 9. YEN MAY RISE TO 140 TO THE DOLLAR, NIKKEIREN SAYS The yen could rise to 140 yen to the dollar, a leading Japanese businessman said. Bumpei Otsuki, president of the influential Japan Federation of Employers\\' Associations, (Nikkeiren), told reporters: \"The yen might rise as far as 140 (to the dollar). The U.S. Economy is not good, and as long as the U.S. Economy is not good, the U.S. Will put various pressures (on Japan).\" \"The yen\\'s level depends on the condition of the U.S. Economy rather than Japan\\'s economy, and as long as the American situation is bad, the yen will continue to rise,\" he said. To cope with the negative impact of the strong yen, Japanese enterprises must strive to cut costs by all means, including holding down wages as much as possible, Otsuki said. He rejected recent calls from some government quarters for wage increases this year as a means of raising private consumption and thus boosting domestic demand. \"We have to keep wages as low as possible,\" he said. He also said the yen\\'s large and rapid rise is depressing the outlook for the Japanese economy, noting that in addition to hurting exporters it is also damaging domestic market manufacturers through cheap imports. Parts of the service sector are also threatened, Otsuki said. Tertiary industries provide services to manufacturers and a downturn in manufacturing profits will adversely affect service industries, he said. It is also doubtful whether the tertiary sector can fully employ those put out of work in the manufacturing sector, he said. Profits of service sector companies are likely to fall in the business year ending in March 1988, leading to a possible recession in the Japanese economy, he said. Otsuki said economic growth is unlikely to pick up beyond levels experienced in 1986. The government\\'s Economic Planning Agency said last week the economy grew at 2.5 pct in 1986, the worst performance since 1974 when the economy shrank 1.4 pct due to the first oil price crisis. In order to stimulate domestic demand and boost the economy, tax reforms aimed at bringing down the cost of land and reforming the nation\\'s housing stock are needed, along with steps to bring down the high cost of commodities, he said. SAUDI RIYAL DEPOSIT RATES EASE Saudi riyal interbank deposit rates eased across the board in a dull market which was long in day-to-day funds, dealers said. Today\\'s quiet market continued a lull of several days in which traders were said to be waiting on the sidelines ahead of further clues to the direction of oil prices and the Saudi economy. Dealers cited some borrowing interest in two, three, and six-month deposits but said activity focused on short dates and one-month deposits as banks tried to lend surplus funds. Spot-next was put at 5-3/4, 5-1/4 pct, down from six, 5-1/2 yesterday while one-week rates were steady at six, 5-1/2 pct. One-month deposits declined to 6-1/4, 1/8 pct from 6-1/2, 1/4 on Monday, while three months was barely changed at seven, 6-15/16 pct. The spot riyal was little changed at 3.7501/03 to the dollar after quotes of 3.7498/7501 yesterday. Japan Trade Ministry asks trade houses, exporters to reduce dlr sales, sources Japan Trade Ministry asks trade houses, exporters to reduce dlr sales, sources NEW DUTCH SPECIAL ADVANCES TOTAL 4.2 BILLION The Dutch Central Bank said it allocated 4.183 billion guilders at tender for the new 5.3 pct, nine-day special advances. Bids were fully met for the first 200 mln guilders and for 40 pct above. The new advances for the period March 25 to April 4, replace current 5.3 pct, five day advances totalling 4.003 billion guilders which expire today. Money brokers said yesterday they expected the Bank to allocate about 3.5 billion guilders. JAPAN ASKS TRADERS, EXPORTERS TO CUT DOLLAR SALES The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) has asked about 30 Japanese trading houses and exporters to refrain from excessive dollar selling, trading house officials said. The officials told Reuters MITI asked them to moderate their foreign exchange trading because the excessive rise in the yen will have unfavourable effects on the economy. It made the request by telephone. A MITI official said the ministry has conducted a survey of foreign exchange trading by trade houses and exporters. But he said it was not aimed at moderating dollar selling. The trading house officials said MITI had asked them to undertake foreign exchange transactions with due consideration to the adverse effects excessive exchange rate movements would have on the economy. The MITI official said MITI undertakes such surveys when exchange rates fluctuate widely. A similiar survey was made when the currency fell to the previous record low of 149.98 on January 19. It hit a new record low of 148.20 yen yesterday. He said the survey showed currency transactions by trade houses and exporters contributed little to the dollar fall. MIDDLE EAST CURRENCY MARKET SEES KEY CHANGES Middle East currency dealers meet in Abu Dhabi this weekend at a time of fundamental change in their business, which has seen a growing volume of trade shift from the Arab world to London. The 14th congress of the Inter-Arab Cambiste Association also comes at a time when the prospect of a unified Gulf currency system is more real that at any time this decade. Foreign exchange traders and bank treasurers said these issues, and the slide of the Lebanese pound, can be expected to be major talking points. About 250 traders and treasurers from some 115 banks -- including some in London and other major non-Arab financial centres -- are expected to attend the conference which begins on on Saturday. Bankers said it is hard to avoid the impression that a growing proportion of transactions in the Saudi riyal market, by far the largest in the region, is being carried out in London. The market had been dominated by Saudi Arabia\\'s 11 banks, foreign exchange houses in the Kingdom and offshore banks in Bahrain. But bankers said more and more Saudi and Bahrain-based banks are boosting their treasury operations in London. As recession hit the Middle East and the need for trade finance in the region declined, many offshore banks in Bahrain ran down their currency operations. None of the four major U.K. Clearing banks now has a dealing room on the island. The two major Bahrain-based international banks, &lt;Arab Banking Corp> and &lt;Gulf International Bank BSC> have increased their presence in London and Saudi banks are busy upgrading representative offices to branch status to allow dealing. One economist said: \"It is cheaper to run a riyal book in London than staff an expensive offshore operation in Bahrain... There is now the nucleus of a two-way market in London.\" Jeddah-based &lt;Riyad Bank> set up as a licensed deposit taker in London in 1984, while its main rival in Saudi Arabia, &lt;National Commercial Bank> (NCB) won a licence in November 1986. The major market maker has traditionally been London-based consortium bank &lt;Saudi International Bank> but the kingdom joint-venture &lt;Saudi American Bank> (SAMBA) also upgraded its London operation to deposit taker status in mid-February. One senior currency trader in Riyadh said: \"Inevitably the volume of business in London has gained pace with the two new licences for NCB and SAMBA, but there is no question that most of the liquidity still rests in Saudi Arabia.\" Currency traders said the shift to London in the Saudi riyal market is difficult to quantify. Bahrain Monetary Agency figures show regional currency deposits held by offshore banks, most in Saudi riyals, dropped to the equivalent of 12.2 billion dlrs at end-September 1986 from 13.4 billion at end-1985 and a 1983 peak of 15.0 billion. The shift has prompted changes in dealing habits. Riyal trading in the Gulf on Saturdays and Sundays has become very quiet with London closed while some Saudi and Bahrain banks now staff offices on Friday, the Gulf weekend. Traders also expect &lt;Arab National Bank> to step up London operations. Traders say it is difficult to foresee the riyal market moving completely out of the region, partly because of local demand and partly because of what is seen as the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency\\'s (SAMA) desire to moderate internationalisation of the riyal and protect it from undue speculation. There have been far fewer signs of the Kuwaiti dinar market shifting from its natural base of Kuwait and trading in Bahrain and London is still limited. But for the first time since the formation of the six nation Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) in 1981 there are signs that a much mooted currency union could come into force soon. Currency traders said it remains unclear what form a final currency union would take for the six states -- Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. But plans to link the six currencies in a European Monetary System style with a common peg have been discussed at high level and could be a topic on the GCC\\'s annual summit expected to be held in Saudi Arabia late in the year. One dealer said: \"A lot of exposure is being given to discussions and plans appear to be quite advanced. But in the end a political decision has to be taken to give the go-ahead.\" One open question is that of a common peg for currencies. The idea of linking the six currencies has been debated since the start of the GCC. The Kuwaiti dinar is currently linked to a basket of currencies while the other five currencies are either officially or in practice linked to the U.S. Dollar. Some traders said a currency union could mean speculation against the Saudi riyal rubbing off on other Gulf currencies, but plans call for a permitted divergence in the system of 7-1/4 pct, large enough to avoid sudden strains. Another topic for debate is expected to be the continued slide of the Lebanese pound against the dollar and the undermining of the effective capital base of Lebanese banks. YEN MAY RISE TO 140 TO THE DLR, NIKKEIREN SAYS The yen could rise to 140 yen to the dollar, a leading Japanese businessman said. Bumpei Otsuki, president of the influential Japan Federation of Employers\\' Associations, (Nikkeiren), told reporters: \"The yen might rise as far as 140 (to the dollar).

U.K. MONEY MARKET FORECAST REVISED TO SHOW SURPLUS The Bank of England said it had revised its forecast of the liquidity position in the money market today to a surplus of 150 mln stg after it estimated a flat position earlier this morning. BANK OF ENGLAND DOES NOT OPERATE IN MONEY MARKET The Bank of England said it had not operated in the money market during the morning session. Earlier, the Bank revised its forecast of the liquidity position in the system today to a surplus of 150 mln stg from its original estimate of a flat position.

CENTRAL BANKS BUY DOLLARS FOR YEN IN LONDON The Bank of Japan intervened to stem strong yen rises against the dollar during London trading this morning, dealers said. The Bank of Japan here declined comment. The Bank of England was also rumored to be buying dollars against the yen this morning but it also declined comment. Dealers said the intervention halted a sudden late morning drop to a low of 148.65 yen, holding the dollar steady until midsession at about 148.80. The Bank of England was strongly rumored to have intervened on behalf of the dollar against the yen yesterday, but it gave no confirmation. Overnight reports from Tokyo said that the Bank of Japan was aggressively supporting the dollar, but failed to push it back to the perceived target level of 150 yen. Selling during the London trading morning was largely attributed to Japanese institutions. Dealers here were loath to quantify the scale of Bank of Japan action this morning. One U.S. Bank trader said it could have been up to 500 mln dlrs, but said this was largely a guess. NO BUNDESBANK POLICY CHANGES EXPECTED THURSDAY The Bundesbank is unlikely to change its credit policies at its central bank council meeting on Thursday, as exchange rates and short-term interest rates have stabilized over the past few weeks, money market dealers said. Attention in the money market is focused on tomorrow\\'s tender for a securities repurchase pact, from which funds will be credited on Thursday, when an earlier pact expires, draining 16 billion marks from the system. The tender was announced last Friday, because carnival festivities closed banks in Duesseldorf yesterday, and will close banks here this afternoon. Because of the disruption to business from carnival, minimum reserve figures for the start of the month are unrealistic, making it difficult for banks to assess their needs at the tender. Dealers said the Bundesbank would want to inject enough liquidity in this week\\'s pact to keep short-term rates down. But because of uncertainty about banks\\' current holdings, the Bundesbank may well allocate less than 16 billion marks this week, and top it up if necessary at next week\\'s tender. \"I would not be surprised if the Bundesbank cuts the amount a little, to say 14 or 15 billion marks,\" one dealer said. \"They would then stock it up at the next tender when the need is clearer,\" he added. An earlier pact expires next week, draining 8.5 billion marks from the system. Banks also face a heavy but temporary drain this month from a major tax deadline for customers. Banks held 52.0 billion marks on February 27 at the Bundesbank, averaging 51.0 billion over the whole month, just clear of the 50.5 billion February reserve requirement. Call money traded today at 3.85/95 pct, up from 3.80/90 yesterday. U.K. MONEY MARKET SURPLUS REVISED TO 250 MLN STG The Bank of England said it revised up its forecast of today\\'s surplus in the money markets to 250 mln stg from its earlier estimate of a 150 mln. The central bank has not operated in the market today. Bundesbank buys dollars for yen - Frankfurt dealers Bundesbank buys dollars for yen - Frankfurt dealers BUNDESBANK BUYS DOLLARS IN FRANKFURT - DEALERS The Bundesbank bought large amounts of dollars for yen in an apparent attempt to hold the dollar above 149 yen, dealers said. The dollar intervention was in concert with some other central banks, they said. Dealers said the Bank of Japan and Bank of England supported the dollar against the yen earlier today and that these two banks and the U.S. Federal Reserve were also active yesterday. The Bundesbank declined to comment on the dealers\\' remarks. Dealers said the intervention underlined the determination of central banks to keep currencies within recent ranges following last month\\'s agreement in Paris by six leading countries to foster currency stability. One dealer said he had been repeatedly in contact with the Bundesbank during the morning to see if it wanted to buy dollars after the Japanese and U.K. Central bank moves. He said the Bundesbank told him it was observing the situation to see if it should intervene in consultation with other central banks. Since the Paris agreement on February 22 the dollar had until yesterday traded in a 1.8150-1.8700 mark range, and above 150 yen, with traders reluctant to push the dollar down to test central banks\\' resolve to defend currency stability. But the test came this week with the dollar falling below 1.81 marks and 150 yen. Dealers said a reviving trade dispute between Washington and Tokyo and growing sentiment that the dollar would have to fall further to narrow the obstinate U.S. Trade deficit were behind the weakness. This week\\'s intervention showed central banks were prepared to cooperate to defend the Paris pact, dealers said. Dealers said it was significant the West German and British central banks were supporting the dollar against the yen. That showed the pact involved multilateral cooperation by central banks to foster currency stability, they said. But it was unclear how such cooperation was being arranged and how frequent consultations between central banks were. BANK OF ENGLAND DRAINS MONEY MARKET LIQUIDITY The Bank of England said it drained liquidity from the money market when it sold 167 mln stg of treasury bills due March 27 at rates between 9-9/16 and 10 pct. Earlier, the bank estimated a surplus of around 250 mln stg in the system today. FED EXPECTED TO ADD RESERVES IN MARKET The Federal Reserve will probably intervene in the government securities market to add reserves today, economists said. They expected the Fed will supply temporary reserves indirectly via 1.5 to two billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreements. Fed funds hovered at a relatively high 6-1/4 pct this morning after averaging 6.14 pct on Tuesday. Early this afternoon the Fed also is expected to supply reserves permanently, effective Thursday, by offering to buy all maturities of Treasury bills. JOHNSON SAYS FED\\'S ACTIONS YESTERDAY MEANT TO STABILIZE DOLLAR AT CURRENT LEVELS JOHNSON SAYS FED\\'S ACTIONS YESTERDAY MEANT TO STABILIZE DOLLAR AT CURRENT LEVELS NO BUNDESBANK POLICY CHANGES EXPECTED THURSDAY The Bundesbank is unlikely to change its credit policies at its central bank council meeting on Thursday, as exchange rates and short-term interest rates have stabilized over the past few weeks, money market dealers said. Attention in the money market is focused on tomorrow\\'s tender for a securities repurchase pact, from which funds will be credited on Thursday, when an earlier pact expires, draining 16 billion marks from the system. The tender was announced last Friday, because carnival festivities closed banks in Duesseldorf yesterday, and will close banks here this afternoon. Because of the disruption to business from carnival, minimum reserve figures for the start of the month are unrealistic, making it difficult for banks to assess their needs at the tender. Dealers said the Bundesbank would want to inject enough liquidity in this week\\'s pact to keep short-term rates down. But because of uncertainty about banks\\' current holdings, the Bundesbank may well allocate less than 16 billion marks this week, and top it up if necessary at next week\\'s tender. \"I would not be surprised if the Bundesbank cuts the amount a little, to say 14 or 15 billion marks,\" one dealer said. \"They would then stock it up at the next tender when the need is clearer,\" he added. An earlier pact expires next week, draining 8.5 billion marks from the system. Banks also face a heavy but temporary drain this month from a major tax deadline for customers. Banks held 52.0 billion marks on February 27 at the Bundesbank, averaging 51.0 billion over the whole month, just clear of the 50.5 billion February reserve requirement. Call money traded today at 3.85/95 pct, up from 3.80/90 yesterday. U.K. MONEY MARKET SHORTAGE FORECAST REVISED UP The Bank of England said it revised up its forecast of the shortage in the money market today to around 500 mln stg from its initial estimate of 350 mln. TREASURY\\'S BAKER SEES CUT IN TRADE DEFICIT Treasury Secretary James Baker said the administration is confident the effect of exchange rate changes will bring about a cut in the trade deficit this year. In testimony before the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs, Baker conceded that the effect thus far has \"not yet proved as quick or as strong as had been expected from past experience.\" He told the committee, however, that the \"initial signs are encouraging.\" U.K. MONEY MARKET GIVEN 24 MLN STG ASSISTANCE The Bank of England said it provided 24 mln stg help to the money market in the morning session. This compares with the bank\\'s upward revised shortage forecast of around 500 mln stg. The central bank purchased bank bills outright comprising two mln stg in band one at 10-7/8 pct and 22 mln stg in band two at 10-13/16 pct. BAKER SAYS U.S. WILLING TO COOPERATE TO STABILIZE EXCHANGE RATES BAKER SAYS U.S. WILLING TO COOPERATE TO STABILIZE EXCHANGE RATES BAKER SAYS U.S. WANTS TO STABILIZE EXCHANGE RATES Treasury Secretary James Baker said the United States and other nations were willing to cooperate to stabilize foreign exchange rates at the levels that existed at the time of an international agreement last month. \"Our position with respect to the dollar goes back to the Paris Agreement that the currencies were within ranges broadly consistent with underlying economic conditions,\" Baker told a Senate committee. Baker continued, \"We said further that we and others are willing to cooperate closely to foster stability in exchange rates around those levels.\" He referred to a February agreement by six leading industrial nations to cooperate on monetary matters. Baker refused to answer a question whether Japan and Germany had done enough to stimulate their domestic economies for the United States to support the dollar. \"I will not comment because the foreign exchange market reads more or less than is intended in my statements,\" Baker said. Baker said that the other signatories recognized that they must carry their share of the load of correcting external imbalances that have hindered the world\\'s economy. He cited news reports that Germany would increase a proposed tax cut for 1988 by about five billion marks to stimulate domestic growth. Japan also agreed to consider stimulative measures after the Japanese budget was made final. Baker said those nations were stimulating their economies in a manner consistent with gains against inflation. EXCHANGE RATE BILL CLEARS U.S. HOUSE PANEL The House Banking Committee adopted legislation to direct the U.S. Treasury to begin negotiations aimed at seeking regular adjustment of exchange rates by countries such as Taiwan and South Korea, whose currencies are pegged to the value of the U.S. dollar. The measure was adopted as part of a wide-ranging trade bill that will be considered by the full House in April before it moves on to the Senate. The bill\\'s many provisions also set as a priority for the U.S. the negotiation of stable exchange rates and urge government intervention as necessary to offset fluctuations. In addition, the Banking Committee bill would authorize U.S. banks to use a variety of means to deal with the debt problems of developing countries, such as lowering interest rates on existing debt, renegotiating loans or debt forgiveness. The bill would give a blanket waiver of any federal banking regulations that bar such actions. The bill would direct Treasury Secretary James Baker to discuss with debt-ridden developing countries the possibility of the U.S. setting up a public debt management agency that would purchase their debt at a discount and negotiate the restructuring of the debt. The Banking bill authorizes U.S. participation in a multilateral investment guarantee agency (MIGA) as requested by the administration. Congress would approve an initial U.S. subscription of 22 mln dlrs. And, it sets up a council on industrial competitiveness composed of industry and administration members to explore ways to make the U.S. more competitive in world markets.

TREASURY\\'S BAKER SAYS HE STANDS BY PARIS PACT TO FOSTER STABLE CURRENCIES TREASURY\\'S BAKER SAYS HE STANDS BY PARIS PACT TO FOSTER STABLE CURRENCIES BAKER SAYS HE STANDS BY PARIS CURRENCY AGREEMENT Treasury Secretary James Baker said he stood by the Paris agreement among leading industrial nations to foster exchange rate stability around current levels. \"I would refer you to the Paris agreement which was a recognition the currencies were within ranges broadly consistent with economic fundamentals,\" Baker told The Cable News Network in an interview. \"We were quite satisfied with the agreement in Paris otherwise we would not have been a party too it,\" he said. Baker also noted the nations agreed in the accord to \"co-operate to foster greater exchange rate stability around those levels.\" He refused to comment directly on the current yen/dollar rate but said flatly that foreign exchange markets recently tended \"to draw unwarranted inferences from what I say.\" Baker was quoted on British Television over the weekend as saying he has no target for the U.S. currency, a statement that triggered this week\\'s renewed decline of the dollar. \"I think the Paris agreement represents evidence that international economic policy co-ordination is alive and well,\" Baker said. The Treasury Secretary stressed however it was very important for the main surplus countries to grow as fast as they could consistent with low inflation to resolve trade imbalances. He added that Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker has also \"been very outspoken\" in suggesting main trading partners grow as fast as they can. Baker noted that the J-curve, the delayed beneficial effect of a weakening of a currency on that country\\'s trade balance, takes 12 to 18 months to work its way through to the trade deficit and it is now 18 months since the Plaza agreement to lower the dollar\\'s value. He also said improvements in the trade deficit should come from other sources besides the exchange rate, and pointed out the administration\\'s package to improve U.S. Competitiveness was now before Congress. Sumita says further yen rise would adversely affect Japanese economy Sumita says further yen rise would adversely affect Japanese economy Sumita says major nations will continue to cooperate to stabilize currencies Sumita says major nations will continue to cooperate to stabilize currencies FURTHER YEN RISE WOULD HURT JAPAN ECONOMY, SUMITA Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita said a further yen rise would have adverse effects on the Japanese economy. He told Japanese business leaders the Bank of Japan will continue to take adequate measures, including market intervention, to stabilize exchange rates if necessary, in close cooperation with other major industrialized nations. He said the current instability of exchange rates will not last. Six major nations - Britain, Canada, France, Japan, the U.S. And West Germany - agreed in Paris last month to act together to hold currencies stable. Sumita said the Bank of Japan will continue to pursue adequate and flexible monetary policies while watching economic and financial developments in and outside Japan. He said the decision to cut the discount rate on February 20 was a hard choice for the Bank because monetary conditions had already been sufficiently eased. To prevent a resurgence of inflation, the Bank will take a very cautious stance regarding developments stemming from easy credit conditions, he said. He said the latest discount rate cut to 2.5 pct should stabilize exchange rates and expand domestic demand. Commenting on the dollar\\'s fall below 150 yen, Sumita reiterated he cannot find any specific reason for the currency\\'s weakness. The market undertook speculative dollar selling by reacting to overseas comments by monetary authorities and trade tension, he said. Sumita repeated that the Japanese economy may gradually recover in the latter half of the 1987/88 fiscal year ending April 1, 1988, provided exchange rates stabilize. MIYAZAWA SAYS MAJOR NATIONS ACTING ON PARIS ACCORD Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said major nations are taking action to stabilise exchange rates in line with their agreement in Paris last month, government sources said. Miyazawa told an Upper House session the six nations -- Britain, Canada, France, Japan, the U.S. And West Germany -- are abiding by the Paris accord. The six agreed to cooperate to stabilise exchange rates at around current levels. Miyazawa said he wishes to attend a meeting of seven major nations (G-7) expected just before the IMF/World Bank Interim Committee meeting in Washington starting on April 9. The sources quoted Miyazawa as saying Japan is trying to prevent a further rise of the yen. Japan is taking the matter seriously, he added. Asked if the six nations had agreed to stabilise the dollar at about 153 yen, the rate prevailing at the time of the Paris talks, Miyazawa declined to give specific figures and said any mention of specific rates would create an \"unexpected situation.\" BANK OF FRANCE LAUNCHES MONEY MARKET INTERVENTION TENDER - OFFICIAL BANK OF FRANCE LAUNCHES MONEY MARKET INTERVENTION TENDER - OFFICIAL BANK OF FRANCE LAUNCHES MONEY MARKET TENDER The Bank of France said it set a money market intervention tender today to inject funds to the market against first category paper. Money market sources said the surprise announcement might herald a quarter percentage point cut in the central bank intervention rate from the 7-3/4 pct level set March 10, but they added such a cut was relatively unlikely. The intervention rate was cut from eight pct on March 10 after being raised from 7-1/4 pct on January 2 to head off speculative pressure against the franc. Dealers said market fundamentals could justify a further easing, but a combination of technical factors and renewed currency uncertainties surrounding the dollar had put short-term upside pressure on interest rates in recent sessions. Call money rose yesterday to 7-7/8 eight pct from 7-3/4 7/8 pct. Today it was first indicated at 8-1/8 1/4 before easing on news of the tender to 7-13/16 7/8 pct. Technical factors making for a slight shortage of liquidity in the market included the settlement yesterday of the latest monthly treasury tap stock tender, on March 5, market sources said. U.K. MONEY MARKET LIQUIDITY POSITION EXPECTED FLAT The Bank of England said it has forecast a flat position in the money market today. Among the main factors, maturing assistance and take-up of treasury bills will drain 545 mln stg and a rise in note circulation 35 mln stg but the outflow will be offset by 490 mln stg exchequer transactions and bankers balances above target 70 mln. SHORT-DATED SAUDI RIYAL RATES FIRM IN QUIET MARKET Short-dated Saudi riyal interest rates firmed but other rates were steady in quiet trading, dealers said. \"Day-to-day money is a bit tighter,\" one trader said. Overnight rose two points to six pct, while most quotes for tomorrow/next and spot/next were 1/2 point higher at around six, 5-1/2 pct. The periods were essentially steady at 5-7/8, 5/8 pct for one month, 6-1/2, 3/8 pct for three, and 6-7/8, 11/16 for six months. The spot riyal stood at 3.7500/05 to the dollar after 3.7506/09 yesterday. MONETARY AUTHORITIES SAID TO LOSE CREDIBILITY The monetary authorities of the major industrialised countries lost their credibility this week as the dollar was sold off despite pleas from ministers and widespread central bank intervention, dealers said. The dollar\\'s fall below 150 yen, which follows last month\\'s Paris currency stabilisation agreement by the U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain, France and Canada, is a dramatic reversal of the success of the Group of Five (G-5) 1985 New York Plaza meeting to weaken the dollar, they said. The G-5 and the market agreed in 1985 that the dollar was overvalued but this time the market and the authorities are on different sides, dealers said. Apparent confusion in the ranks of the G-5 nations has encouraged the market to challenge the authorities despite concerted intervention by the central banks of the United States, Japan, Britain and West Germany, they said. Pleas by Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa for action to stabilise the dollar were matched over the weekend by comments by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker that there was no target zone for the dollar. The dollar was sold anyway. Yesterday\\'s comment by Baker that he stood by the Paris accord did nothing to reverse sentiment, dealers said. The intervention, backed by remarks by Fed Chairman Paul Volcker and Japanese central bank governor Satoshi Sumita, which a few months ago would have brought the dollar fall to a halt, has done little but slow the rate of its decline, they noted. The situation has again raised the question of whether intervention can succeed against the trend in today\\'s huge currency markets. Dealers said the market\\'s cool response to intervention reflected a basic oversupply of dollars. \"This means that the current dollar selling is not of a sheer speculative nature but backed by real demand,\" said Koichi Miyazaki, deputy general manager at Sanwa Bank. Dealers said the dollar will remain weak despite the intervention and it is only a matter of time before some operators try to push it below 148 yen. The dollar closed in Tokyo today at 149.40 against New York\\'s 149.30/40. Its record low was 148.40 in Tokyo last Tuesday. Dealers said the dollar will gain only temporary support to rise above 150 yen toward early April when the Group of Seven industrial nations meets to discuss currencies again. The market expects the seven nations (the Paris six plus Italy) to try to agree on another way to stabilise currencies apart from intervention, a chief dealer at a U.S. Bank said. Dealers said they were unsure what other methods could be used and they are sceptical anyway about how long the Paris accord nations, particulary the U.S., Will remain willing to prevent a further dollar fall given the continuing high U.S. Trade deficit, especially with Japan. Further pressure from a protectionist U.S. Congress for a lower dollar is also limiting Washington\\'s options, they said. The market now thinks the central bank action is to slow the dollar fall, not to push it back over 150 yen, said Tadahiko Nashimoto, manager at Long Term Credit Bank of Japan. Another bearish factor for the dollar is expected large forward dollar sales from April to June for export bills falling due for Japanese exporters from April to September. The exporters had delayed in expectation of a further yen depreciation, dealers said. Yesterday\\'s request to 30 trading houses by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry to restrict dollar sales looks ineffective in light of this real demand, they said. The market is also anticipating active institutional dollar sales to hedge currency risks on bond holdings from the new business year starting April 1, dealers said. \"The market seems to have established a new dollar trading range between 147 and 149 yen,\" one dealer said. The dollar traded between 151 and 153 yen after the Paris accord on February 22 and 150 yen was then considered the low end for the dollar against the yen, he said. Some dealers now believe that if the dollar falls below 148 yen, it will pick up renewed downward momentum and slide to 145. U.K. MONEY MARKET FORECAST REVISED TO DEFICIT The Bank of England said it revised its estimate of today\\'s money market shortfall to around 350 mln stg from a flat position. BANK OF JAPAN BUYS SMALL QUANTITY DOLLARS -DEALERS The Bank of Japan was thought to have bought a small amount of dollars at around 149.30/40 yen, dealers said. The dollar fluctuated marginally after the small-scale intervention, believed to total several tens of mlns of dlrs, they said. Large-scale buying by foreign banks or by a life insurance company earlier pushed the dollar upwards, they said. Trading was not very active and dealers were watching for further central bank intervention to smooth out any sharp movements, but underlying dollar sentiment is still bearish. U.K. TRADE FIGURES BUOY HOPES OF INTEREST RATE CUT The release of U.K. February trade data showing that the current account surplus was a provisional 376 mln stg, up from a 73 mln surplus in January, has boosted hopes of an early cut in interest rates, analysts said. Market forecasts had been for a worse outcome, with expectations of a deficit in visible trade averaging about 750 mln stg, against the official figure of 224 mln stg, sharply narrower than January\\'s 527 mln deficit. \"The figures are unreservedly good,\" Chase Manhattan Securities economist Andrew Wroblewski said. Sterling rebounded on the trade figures, reversing a weaker morning trend, to stand at 72.1 pct of its trade weighted index against a basket of currencies at midday, unchanged from yesterday\\'s close but 0.3 points above the 1100 GMT level. The market had feared that a deteriorating non-oil trade pattern would undermine international support for sterling, which has been the motor behind the recent fall in U.K. Interest rates. Money market sources said the market had begun to doubt that a widely expected drop in bank base lending rates to 9.5 pct from the present 10.0 pct was really on the cards. But sentiment now looks to have turned about again. There now looks to be no danger that the Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson\\'s forecast of a 1987 current account deficit of 2.5 billion stg will be exceeded, Wroblewski said. Seasonally adjusted figures showed imports rose in February to 7.16 billion stg from 6.73 billion in January. Exports rose to a record 6.93 billion from 6.20 billion. However, Chris Tinker, U.K. Analyst at brokers Phillips and Drew said the faster rise in exports than imports would prove partly aberrational in coming months. He forecast the Chancellor\\'s Budget tax cuts would increase consumer expenditure on imported goods. However, Warburg Securities economist Ian Harwood said his firm was sharply revising its 1987 current account deficit forecast in the light of the latest data, cutting one billion stg off the expected full year total to about 1.75 billion stg. He said news of strong growth in exports of non-oil goods confirmed recent bullish surveys among members of the Confederation of British Industry. The growth in imports appears to be flattening, even if January\\'s bad weather had curbed consumer spending on overseas goods and import-intensive stock building among manufacturers, Harwood said. U.K. Government bonds, or gilts, surged by more than 1/2 point on the better-than-expected news, as earlier worries about the figures evaporated. Sterling peaked at a high of 1.6075 dlrs, before settling to a steady 1.6050 about 1300 GMT, nearly a cent higher than the European low of 1.5960. However, analysts noted that the turnabout in market sentiment still looks highly vulnerable to political news. Morning weakness in sterling and the gilt market was largely attributed to a newspaper opinion poll showing that the Conservative government\\'s support was slipping. LONDON, March 26 - The Bank of England said it provided 15 mln stg in assistance to the money market this morning, buying bank bills in band two at 9-13/16 pct. Earlier the Bank revised its money market liquidity forecast from a flat position to a deficit of around 350 mln stg. CURRENCY EXCHANGE LOSS PUSHES MALAYSIA\\'S DEBT UP An exchange loss of 7.6 billion ringgit in 1986 pushed Malaysia\\'s outstanding external debt up to 50.99 billion ringgit, from 1985\\'s 42.3 billion, the Central Bank said in its annual report. Bank Negara said although Malaysia\\'s net borrowing dropped in 1986, its external debt rose due to the 30 pct appreciation of the basket of currencies against which the ringgit is pegged. The basket comprises principally the U.S. Dollar, yen, mark, Swiss franc, French franc, sterling, guilder, Canadian and Singapore dollars, it added. Bank Negara said growth in external debt, which declined progressively from a peak of 58 pct in 1982 to 13.6 pct in 1985, rose by 20.2 pct in 1986. Malaysia\\'s debt serving ratio of 17.6 pct of its exports in 1986 is within the prudency limit of 20 pct, Bank Negara Governor Jaafar Hussein told reporters. TREASURY\\'S BAKER SAYS HE STANDS BY PARIS PACT Treasury Secretary James Baker said he stood by the Paris agreement among leading industrial nations to foster exchange rate stability around current levels. \"I would refer you to the Paris agreement which was a recognition the currencies were within ranges broadly consistent with economic fundamentals,\" Baker told The Cable News Network in an interview. \"We were quite satisfied with the agreement in Paris otherwise we would not have been a party too it,\" he said.

U.K. Government bonds, or gilts, surged by more than 1/2 point on the better-than-expected news, as earlier worries about the figures evaporated. Sterling peaked at a high of 1.6075 dlrs, before settling to a steady 1.6050 dlrs about 1300 GMT, nearly a cent higher than the European low of 1.5960. However, analysts noted that the turnabout in market sentiment still looks highly vulnerable to political news. Morning weakness in sterling and the gilt market was largely attributed to a newspaper opinion poll showing that the Conservative government\\'s support was slipping. The Marplan poll, published in \"Today,\" showed Conservative support had fallen to 36 pct, from 38 pct last month, while the Alliance of Liberals and Social Democrats had rallied to 31 pct, from 21 pct, to run neck and neck with the Labour Party, whose own support fell from 38 pct. The poll was taken after the Budget, which was greeted enthusiastically by financial markets but seems to have left the voters indifferent, political observers said. Another regular poll is due tomorrow, and eonomists warn that today\\'s improved sentiment could be dented if support for Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher slips again. This upsetting of the markets\\' political perceptions, which are all but discounting a Conservative victory in the upcoming general election, made them more sensitive to the trade data, Harwood said. \"The news did come as a very, very substantial relief,\" he said. However, on the interest rate front, economists caution that Lawson might be wary of leaving sterling vulnerable by encouraging another base rate fall. They noted Lawson had already got an inflation-reducing cut in mortgage rates in response to lower base rates, so domestic political reasons for lower rates have been curtailed. U.S. TREASURY\\'S MULFORD REAFFIRMS G-6 PACT TO FOSTER CURRENCY STABILITY AROUND CURRENT LEVELS U.S. TREASURY\\'S MULFORD REAFFIRMS G-6 PACT TO FOSTER CURRENCY STABILITY AROUND CURRENT LEVELS TREASURY\\'S MULFORD SAYS G-6 HAS NO CURRENCY TARGET ZONES, RANGES TREASURY\\'S MULFORD SAYS G-6 HAS NO CURRENCY TARGET ZONES, RANGES U.K. MONEY MARKET RECEIVES 226 MLN STG ASSISTANCE The Bank of England said it operated in the money market this afternoon, buying 226 mln stg in bills. In band one, the central bank bought 37 mln stg treasury bills and 72 mln stg bank bills at 9-7/8 pct together with 117 mln stg band two bank bills at 9-13/16 pct. This brings total money market help so far today to 241 mln stg and compares with the Bank\\'s revised estimate of a 350 mln stg shortfall. BANK OF FRANCE LEAVES MONEY MARKET INTERVENTION RATE UNCHANGED AT 7-3/4 PCT - OFFICIAL BANK OF FRANCE LEAVES MONEY MARKET INTERVENTION RATE UNCHANGED AT 7-3/4 PCT - OFFICIAL BANK OF FRANCE BUYS DOLLARS, SELLS YEN - DEALERS BANK OF FRANCE BUYS DOLLARS, SELLS YEN - DEALERS U.S TREASURY\\'S MULFORD REAFFIRMS G-6 AGREEMENT Treasury Assistant Secretary David Mulford reaffirmed U.S. backing for the Paris Agreement among six industrial nations to cooperate closely to foster exchange rate stability around current levels. In testimony prepared for delivery before a Senate banking subcommittee, Mulford said there was broad recognition in Paris that \"further substantial exchange rate shifts could damage growth and adjustment prospects.\" But he also said while there are clear understandings among the countries regarding cooperation, \"We have refrained from establishing a system of target zones or ranges.\" Mulford also said the six nations have not spelled out the way in which they intend to deal with possible market developments. He said governments must retain flexibility in dealing with exchange market pressures and efforts to establish rigid exchange rate objectives \"or to specify too precisely the goals of intervention\" would hurt official attempts to react to market pressures, he said. Accordingly, Mulford said setting specific currency objectives and intervention to achieve those objectives would be counterproductive. Commenting on the trade deficit, Mulford reiterated the Treasury position that the current account deficit will decline from 148 billion dlrs last year to around 130 billion dlrs this year, due to the exchange rate adjustments of the past 18 months. But he added trade imbalances would also be corrected by commitments from West Germany and Japan to stimulate their economies and by U.S. efforts to cut the budget deficit and enhance U.S. competitiveness. He also said some newly industrialized countries should let their currencies appreciate. BANK OF FRANCE BUYS DOLLARS, SELLS YEN - DEALERS The Bank of France intervened on the market to buy dollars and sell yen to support the U.S. Currency, dealers said. A major French bank said it acted for the central bank in buying between five and 15 mln dlrs against yen. A dealer at another bank said his bank had been asked to publicise the intervention, to send a clear signal to the markets that central banks were acting in concert to maintain the exchange rates agreed to be appropriate at last month\\'s meeting of the Group of Five and Canada in Paris. The dollar was being quoted at 6.0950/70 francs in early afternoon dealings after a fix of 6.09425 francs. The major French bank said it sold yen at a rate of 149.28 against the dollar. The U.S. Currency was subsequently being quoted at 149.25/35. The Bank of Japan was reported in the market overnight to bolster the credibility of the Paris accord following several days of pressure against the dollar. Pressure developed after U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker repeated earlier statements that the Reagan administration had no targets for the dollar, apparently undermining the assumption that the agreement in Paris had fixed broad fluctuation ranges for major currencies. Baker later said his remark had been misinterpreted. U.K. MONEY MARKET GETS 25 MLN STG LATE HELP The Bank of England said it provided about 25 mln stg in late help to the money market, bringing the total assistance today to 266 mln stg. This compares with the bank\\'s revised estimate of a 350 mln stg money market shortfall. MULFORD SAYS G-6 WANTS STABILITY Treasury Assistant Secretary David Mulford said the Paris agreement among leading industrial nations is intended to produce \"reasonable stability\" in exchange markets over the next few months. He told a Senate Banking subcommittee the Group of Five nations and Canada agreed in Paris to \"see if there can\\'t be a period of reasonable stability instead of volatility\" to give time for the committments in Paris to take place. Asked by Sen Phil Gramm (R-Tex) whether U.S. intervention was not in fact overvaluing the dollar, Mulford replied that the administration judged that after economic adjustments, current exchange rates reflect underlying economic fundamentals. In particular, the stability sought by the nations would allow West Germany and Japan to stimulate their economies domestically and the U.S. to cut its budget deficit, Mulford said in his testimony. He stressed that a further sharp fall in the dollar would hurt the ability of Germany and Japan to boost growth. Mulford noted that half of West Germany\\'s economy was affected by international developments. He also said increased Japanese domestic growth would result in more U.S. exports to Japan and would not necessarily lead to greater Japanese capital flows to the U.S., as Gramm asserted, if Japan reformed its domestic capital market. Commenting on the Paris agreement, Mulford said, \"I think exchange rates ought to be stabilized so (Germany\\'s and Japan\\'s) efforts can be carried out. Mulford rejected Gramm\\'s argument that faster domestic growth in Germany and Japan would result in an even lower dollar. Mulford said the administration wanted to achieve a pattern of higher growth overseas as a way of improving the U.S. trade deficit. Otherwise, he said, the trade deficit would be resolved either through a much lower dollar or a U.S. recession, both alternatives he termed unacceptable and undesirable. DOLLAR/YEN INTERVENTION RESPONDS TO PRESSURE The Bank of France intervened to buy small amounts of dollars and sell yen in Paris today to stabilise the exchange rates agreed at last month\\'s meeting of Finance Ministers of the Group of Five and Canada, foreign exchange dealers said. But they said recent central bank intervention in the foreign exchange markets appeared to be a limited reaction to temporary pressures rather than a major defence operation. A Bank of France spokesman declined all comment but sources close to the central bank said it had also intervened yesterday. Dealers said the earlier intervention was in concert with the Bundesbank and Bank of Japan. The sources said the French central bank could have been in the market again today in two-way operations, not necessarily on its own account, but to counter short-term pressures arising from the end of the Japanese financial year on March 31. One major French bank said it bought between five and 15 mln dlrs for the central bank and sold yen at 149.28 to the dollar. Another bank said it had been asked by the Bank of France to say it was in the market, a departure from the central bank\\'s usual insistence on confidentiality. But other banks said they had seen no sign of intervention, which they said appeared to be on a very limited scale. \"Even if 10 banks were buying five to 15 mln dlrs, you would still be talking of a small overall amount,\" said one dealer. Recent intervention by the Bank of Japan appeared mainly to have been required to meet year-end window dressing demand for yen. \"This is a specific short term phenomenon rather than a wider trend,\" the dealer said. Operators have been extremely cautious about testing the dollar\\'s trading ranges against the West German mark and Japanese yen. These ranges were set in February\\'s stabilisation agreement reached here by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker and the Finance Ministers of Japan, Germany, France, Britain and Canada. But speculative pressures started to build again this week after Baker was quoted on British television at the weekend as repeating earlier statements that Washington had no target for the dollar. Baker yesterday moved to defuse speculation he was talking the dollar down, telling a Cable News Network interviewer and a Senate committee he stood by the Paris agreement. Foreign exchange markets had been misreading his comments, he said. MULFORD DISAPPOINTED IN NEWLY INDUSTRIALIZED (NICS) EFFORTS TO STRENGTHEN CURRENCIES MULFORD DISAPPOINTED IN NEWLY INDUSTRIALIZED (NICS) EFFORTS TO STRENGTHEN CURRENCIES MULFORD SAYS GERMANY, JAPAN SHOULD DO MORE Treasury Assistant Secretary David Mulford said he did not believe that West Germany and Japan have yet carried out their international responsibilities. \"I do not believe they have up to this time,\" Mulford told a Senate banking subcommittee. He said that for the U.S. trade deficit to continue improving in the next two years, \"We need more policy actions\" across the entire front of U.S. trade relations, including Canada and the newly-industrialized countries (NICS). In particular, he said, efforts by South Korea and Taiwan to strengthen their currencies were still disappointing. Mulford also said that OECD nations need to grow an average three pct to help resolve the international debt crisis. He noted that Japanese and European imports from Latin nations were significantly smaller than imports into the U.S. He stressed both Germany and Japan must continue to take economic and structural measures to ensure stronger sustained economic growth. GERMAN WAGE ROUND SAID TO LIMIT MONETARY OPTIONS The Bundesbank\\'s options for West Germany monetary policy are limited for the foreseeable future by the delicate stage of wage negotiations between unions and employers, economists and money market dealers said. Call money fell in quite active trading today, dropping to 3.40/50 pct from 3.55/65 pct yesterday, and below the 3.50 pct treasury bill rate as a difficult month-end approached. But dealers and economists said the Bundesbank was unlikely to encourage lower rates in the foreseeable future largely for fear of upsetting the current wage round. One money market dealer for a major foreign bank said, \"I don\\'t think the Bundesbank wants rates to go up whatever happens. But it also does not want them to fall. Above all it wants to wait to see how the unions wage round goes.\" In West Germany, unions and employers prepare the ground for triennial wage negotiations based on detailed assessments of growth and inflation, economists said. Ute Geipel, economist with Citibank AG, said if the Bundesbank became more accommodating in monetary policy, raising fears in some quarters of a return in inflation in the medium term, unions would be obliged to curtail wage demands. As a result the Bundesbank was concerned to make no move that would interfere in the negotiating process, Geipel said. In the current round, the country\\'s most powerful union, the IG Metall representing metalworkers and engineers, is demanding a shortening of the working week to 35 hours from the present 38-1/2 and an accompanying five pct increase in wages. The engineering employers\\' association, Gesamtmetall, is offering to bring in a 38-hour-week from July 1, 1988, and give a two stage wage increase -- a 2.7 pct rise from April 1 this year and another 1.5 pct from July 1, 1988. The agreement forged by IG Metall -- Europe\\'s largest union, with 2.5 mln members -- and the employers would set the benchmark for settlements in other industries such as the public sector, banks and federal post office. Negotiations began in December and unions are hopeful they may conclude by early April, ahead of the traditional holiday period in June. Though many economists said the unions\\' current warning strikes and rhetoric were part of the negotiating strategy and would not lead to a repeat of 1984\\'s damaging seven-week strikes, others said unions would not compromise greatly on their positions and there could still be conflict. This could extend the length of time in which the Bundesbank would keep its activity low-key, economists said. The money market head said the unions\\' humiliation by the protracted financial problems of the Neue Heimat cooperative housing venture would contribute to union obstinacy. \"The unions haven\\'t forgotten that and they will put this squarely onto the account in the negotiations,\" he said. In addition, the newly-elected chairman of the IG Metall union, Franz Steinkuehler, was more radical and determined than his predecessor Hans Meyer and may be set for a longer battle to achieve the best possible settlement for his membership. More than 16,000 engineering workers at 45 firms, mainly in south Germany, held warning strikes lasting up to two hours yesterday. Firms hit included Zahnradfabrik Passau GmbH and aerospace group Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm GmbH. Today, 28,000 employees from 110 companies came out in warning strikes, a statement from IG Metall said. Money market dealers said that overnight call money rates would rise in the near future in any case and did not depend on a politically-inhibited Bundesbank. About eight billion marks were coming into the market tomorrow from salary payments by the federal government. As a result, some banks fell back on the Bundesbank\\'s offer to mop up liquidity via the sale of three-day treasury bills, anticipating still lower rates before the month-end. But a pension payment date by banks on behalf of customers was due on Monday, other dealers noted. If banks were short of liquidity until the bills matured on Tuesday, rates could soar, perhaps to the 5.50 pct Lombard ceiling. Banks were well stocked up with funds, having an average 52.1 billion marks in Bundesbank minimum reserves in the first 24 days of March, well above the 50.7 billion requirement. U.K. MONEY MARKET SHORTAGE FORECAST REVISED DOWN The Bank of England said it had revised its forecast of the shortage in the money market down to 450 mln stg before taking account of its morning operations. At noon the bank had estimated the shortfall at 500 mln stg.'"
